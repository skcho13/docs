      "Britain between lesser achieved fertility and greater wealth was seen to have \n",
      "important long-term consequences. So far the discussion had been limited to the \n",
      "immediate effect on the composition of the population and the increasing \n",
      "preponderance of the unskilled that it entailed. Cobb, however, pointed out that the \n",
      "problem was not just the class-differential rates of reproduction themselves but their \n",
      "population-dynamic consequences: \n",
      "If, however, as I shall try to show, there is a natural tendency under modern conditions for \n",
      "the more intelligent to become less fertile, the problem is a more serious one. \n",
      "If variations in fertility are inherited and the wealthier classes have for generations been put \n",
      "through a process of selection by which members of small families have been given an \n",
      "advantage over members of large families, we should expect that the wealthier classes would, as \n",
      "a whole, be less fertile than the poorer classes. \n",
      "Fisher seized on the idea, and with the engaging enthusiasm (and language) of \n",
      "his 22 years, explained the principle and its harmful consequences:      \n",
      "Mr Cobb points out that in any society which is so organised that members of small families \n",
      "enjoy a social advantage over members of large ones, the qualities of all kinds, physical, mental, \n",
      "and moral which go to make up what may be called “resultant sterility” tend, other things being \n",
      "equal, to rise steadily in the social scale; so that in such a society, the highest social strata, \n",
      "containing the finest representatives of ability, beauty, and taste which the nation can provide, \n",
      "will have, apart from individual inducements, the smallest proportion of descendants; and this \n",
      "dysgenic effect of social selection will extend throughout every class in which any degree of \n",
      "resultant sterility provides a social advantage. \n",
      "We may here note that the argument is not between classes but ‘throughout every \n",
      "class’. It is not a static picture of class differentiation in fertility but of a continuum as \n",
      "in the social scale. The effect described is a dynamic one of social mobility involving \n",
      "the whole population. Geneticists call such a continuum a cline, though exactly what \n",
      "might be the measure of the ‘scale’ of the social cline is open to debate. However, no-\n",
      "one doubts its existence. \n",
      "Fisher continues: \n",
      "It is this principle, vital in its importance and almost universal in its application, which \n",
      "explains to us why civilisations in the past, with one notable exception, and especially urban \n",
      "civilizations, in which the value of wealth is greatly accentuated, have ultimately collapsed \n",
      "owing to the decay of the ruling classes to which they owed their greatness and brilliance. And \n",
      "it is this principle which must underlie the reconstruction of our own civilisation if it is not to \n",
      "share the fate of those which have preceded it. (In a footnote, Fisher says the ‘one notable \n",
      "exception’ is provided by the Nordic civilization of the 10th century.) \n",
      "The paper is incidentally also remarkable for its ending, in which Fisher introduces \n",
      "the notion later called ‘inclusive fitness’ and developed by J.B.S.Haldane, \n",
      "W.D.Hamilton and others to explain the evolution of altruism. He advocates \n",
      "‘versatility’ ‘So that not only in youth, but throughout life, we may retain full \n",
      "sympathy for our fellow men’. \n",
      "His next paper after ‘Some hopes of a eugenist’ is ‘Frequency distribution of \n",
      "the values of the correlation coefficient in samples of an indefinitely large population’ \n",
      "(1915), in which he proved by a novel geometric argument the equation of the \n",
      "distribution function of the coefficient, which hitherto had only been approximated. \n",
      "Knowledge of this function is fundamental to assessing the significance of a \n",
      "correlation, while Fisher’s geometric method of representing a sample in a \n",
      "multidimensional Euclidean space became standard in distribution theory. This paper \n",
      "announced his arrival in the pantheon of mathematical statisticians and gives the lie to \n",
