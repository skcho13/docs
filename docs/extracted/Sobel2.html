<li>INTRODUCTION</li>
</ol>
<p>Heckmanadvocatesanapproachtocausalinferencethatdrawsupon structural modeling of the outcome(s) of interest (which he calls scientific), and he contrasts this approach sharply with that arising out of the statistical literature on experimentation. Drawing exten- sively on several previous papers—for example, Heckman (1997, 2000, 2001) and Heckman and Navarro-Lozano (2004)—Heckman goes even further here, arguing that the statistical literature on causal inference is incomplete because it does not attempt to model the process by which subjects are selected into treatments (or what statis- ticians have called the ‘‘treatment assignment mechanism’’) and that this literature confounds the task of defining parameters with the tasks of identifying and estimating these parameters. I shall return to these points later.</p>
<p>But whereas Heckman distinguishes sharply between these approaches (and hence between certain literatures in economics and statistics), on balance I find the similarities in the approaches he discusses much more profound than the dissimilarities. To elaborate, while there has been and continues to be much philosophical For financial support, I am grateful to the John D. and Catherine T.</p>
<p>MacArthur Foundation. For helpful remarks, I am grateful to the members of thecausalinferencestudygroupatColumbiaUniversity.Addressallcorrespon- dence to Michael Sobel, 421 Fayerweather Hall, Columbia University, New York,NY,10027(ormes105@columbia.edu).</p>
<p>*ColumbiaUniversity literatures, there are strong similarities in the way that the word ‘‘cause’’ is used. In particular, a causal relation sustains a counter- factual conditional, while a noncausal relation need not do so.</p>
<p>Second, causal effects are allowed to be heterogeneous across units, a point that both statisticians and Heckman have emphasized. Third, dovetailing with this shared perspective on the nature of the causal relation,thepotentialoutcomesnotationinventedbyNeyman(1923), widelyusedsincebystatisticiansworkingonexperimentaldesign(see for example, the textbooks by Cox [1958] and Kempthorne [1952]), is now standard notation in both these literatures. This notation, adopted also by Heckman during the latter 1980s and since in a number ofhis papers(andhere) nicely capturesthe idea that acausal relationship sustains a counterfactual conditional statement. To be sure, this idea can be represented in other ways (Robins and Greenland 2000), but the potential outcomes notation is very easy to work with and easy to use without leading oneself astray. The importance of good notation cannot be emphasized strongly enough.</p>
<p>AsWhitehead([1911],1958:39)pointedout,‘‘Byrelievingthebrainof all unnecessary work, a good notation sets it free to concentrate on more advanced problems, and in effect increases the power of the race.’’ I would also propose that the use of a common notation encourages investigators to think similarly about a problem.</p>
<p>The incorporation of Neyman’s notation into the modern literature on causal inference is due to Rubin (1974, 1977, 1978, 1980), who, using this notation, saw the applicability of the work from the statistical literature on experimental design to observational studiesandgaveexplicitconsiderationtothekeyroleofthetreatment assignment mechanism in causal inference, thereby extending this work to observational studies. To be sure, previous workers in statis- tics and economics (and elsewhere) understood well in a less formal waytheproblemsofmakingcausalinferencesinobservationalstudies where respondents selected themselves into treatment groups, as evi- denced,forexample,byCochran’sworkonmatchingandHeckman’s workonsampleselectionbias.ButRubin’sworkwasacriticalbreak- through. The introduction of a suitable notation allowed in principle the clarification and formalization of the problem of making causal inferences with non-experimental data. Further, the use of this notation allowed the tasks of defining etimands to be separated enabledRubinnotonlytopinpointthekeyroleofthetreatmentassign- ment mechanism but to state precise conditions under which this mechanism was ‘‘ignorable’’ or not. These conditions have been used by subsequent workers (including Heckman) to evaluate and clarify existing procedures for causal inference (for example, instrumental variables) and to develop new methods for estimating causal effects (forexample,bycreatingmatchedsamplesusingpropensityscores).</p>
<p>And fourth, although Heckman criticizes the ‘‘treatment effects’’ literature for modeling the effects of causes, as opposed to modeling the causes of effects, the majority of his paper also focuses on modeling the effects of an intervention (cause) on an outcome of interest.</p>
<p>That said, some of the problems involved in making causal inferences about agents who are not (or cannot in practice be) subjected by an investigator to one or another treatment of interest will be somewhat different than those that typically arise when a treatment is applied or not to a plot of land in an agricultural experiment. In the latter case, where a randomized experiment can be conducted, the treatment assignment mechanism is essentially a (possibly biased) coin toss (or a coin toss within distinguishable types of plots). Causal inference is typically more straightforward in this case. However, in observational studies, individuals typically sort themselves into treatment groups and how they do so may also be of independent interest. Economists often argue that individuals make choices by behavingas if they are maximizing expected utility.</p>
<p>When the utility associated with making particular choices is also related to the outcome under consideration, this may create pro- blems when the agent uses more information than that available to theeconomist(ortheeconomistsimplydoesnotknowthetreatment assignment mechanism). In this case, consideration of the available information may be inadequate for a ‘‘sufficient’’ description of the process by which agents allocate themselves to treatment groups.</p>
<p>Here, the assignment mechanism cannot be treated as a coin toss (net of the available information). Thus, methods based on this premise are inadequate for this case. In other social and behavioral sciences, where notions of decision making may take on a different flavor, the above may or may not be problematic. In any event, the point is that even when the same notion of causation is under inference should be expected.</p>
<p>In addition, although assumptions are always present, investi- gatorsdifferintheextenttowhichtheyarecomfortableusingtheseto make inferences. Heckman advocates herein what he has elsewhere (Heckman 2000) called a structural approach to estimating causal parameters. This model based approach can be very powerful and can be used as a basis for generating inferences that are sometimes much stronger and broader in scope than those typically made in the statistical literature Heckman criticizes. But the structural approach also typically features stronger assumptions. As Heckman (2000) documents, frustration with the seemingly arbitrary nature of the assumptions (for example, exclusion restrictions) used to identify structuralmodels has ledseveral generations ofeconomists toeschew structural modeling in favor of other approaches, recently including experimentation(Heckmanisquitecriticalofthis‘‘naturalexperiment movement;’’ for a nice treatment of the issues see Rosenzweig and Wolpin(2000)).Asbefore,evenwhenthesamenotionofcausationis held, some differences in approaches to causal inference should be expected.</p>
<p>However,ifonetakestheviewthatstatisticalproceduresshould be tailored to address questions of interest to various constituencies (for example, different groups of scientists and policymakers), such differences should be regarded as both natural and desirable.</p>
<p>Accordingly, I aim primarilytogive a balancedoverview oftheissues.</p>
<p>To make my discussion as useful as possible for Sociological Methodology readers, I sometimes elaborate on material covered by Heckman in this or previous papers. Second (and primarily for the same reason), my remarks are organized around the following four themes in Heckman’s paper: 1) the nature of the causal relation, 2) definitions of causal estimands, 3) policy evaluation and forecasting, and 4) the identification and estimation of causal effects. Although I do not find simultaneous equation models (and more generally, structural equation models) in their current form very useful for causal inference, I do not take up this subject here, in large measure because a thorough treatment would require substantially increasing the length of an already long discussion.</p>
<p>For some previous and related discussions of causality in sult Strotz and Wold (1960), Fisher (1970), and Sobel (1990).</p>
<p>To improve readability, in most instances, I include here the equations referred to, even if some of these already appear in Heckman’s article. Whenever possible, I use notation similar or iden- tical to Heckman’s. In some instances, in order to retain consistency of style, minor deviations have been necessary.</p>

<li>THE CAUSAL RELATION Heckman argues (page 2, this volume) that ‘‘Science is all about constructing models of the causes of effects’’ (vs.&nbsp;studying the effects ofcauses).Healsoarguesthatthenotionofcausalityinvolvesmanip- ulating one or more variables and comparing the outcomes of these manipulations. Economists perform these (hypothetical) manipula- tions using models. And since models are mental constructs, Heckman concludes that causality resides in the mind. In addition, as different people think different thoughts and therefore construct different models, causes are ‘‘relative’’ (to use the language of Collingwood ([1940], 1972). That is, with equal legitimacy, different investigators may identify different factors as causes, while ignoring others. This is part of what Heckman refers to as the provisional nature of causal knowledge. The implications of this are further discussed in Sobel (1995), which readers may also wish to consult for more background on the causal relation.</li>
</ol>
<p>Modelingthecausesofeffectsiscertainlyanimportantscientific activity. But it should also be understood that many ‘‘scientific’’ ques- tionsarenotcausal.Forexample,NASArecentlycrashedaprobefrom the Deep Impact spacecraft into comet Tempel1 with the objective of learningmoreaboutthestructureandcompositionof cometary nuclei.</p>
<p>See Bunge (1979) for a discussion of the many kinds of noncausal questionsthatareofscientificinterest.Further,studyingtheeffectsof causes is an important scientific activity: figuring out the causes of global warming would be considerably less important if the effects of global warming were inconsequential.</p>
<p>Next,thenatureofthecausalrelationhasconsumedtheatten- tion of philosophers since well before Hume, without resolution.</p>
<p>Regularity theories are one attempt to explicate the nature of thought of as some set of necessary and/or sufficient antecedents for the effect. Regularity theories are both general and (typically) deter- ministic.Inaddition,contemporaryregularitytheoriesusuallyrequire that a causal statement sustain a counterfactual conditional. The foregoing ideas may be expressed mathematically using functions, as in an ‘‘all-causes’’ model: yðsÞ¼g ðx;uÞ; ð1Þ s where y(s) is an outcome of interest depending on state s, g is a s function of x, a vector of observables, and u, a vector of unobserva- bles.Byvaryingthecomponentsofg ,effectsofthearguments(which s may be state specific) can be defined under suitable conditions. In other instances, attention focuses on the results of manipulating the states s, which might, for example, index a set of treatments that are to be applied.</p>

<p>On the other hand, manipulability theories of causation emphasize the ability of a human agent to manipulate a cause: ‘‘A causeisaneventorstateofthingswhichitisinourpowertoproduce or prevent, and by producing or preventing which we can produce or prevent that whose cause it is said to be’’ (Collingwood [1940], 1972: p.&nbsp;296–97). Whereas regularity theories are theories about the causes of effects, manipulability theories are theories about the effects of causes.Suchtheoriescorrespondmorecloselywiththewayanexperi- mentalist thinks of causation. These theories are also readily com- bined with singular theories of the causal relation.</p>
<p>At first glance, it appears that manipulability theories are inherently at odds with regularity theories. Thus, it might be argued that the modern literatures on causal inference in both statistics and econometrics, because these literatures are typically concerned with for example, the effects of a policy intervention, as in Heckman’s paper—are, from the scientific standpoint advocated by Heckman, misdirected. Importantly, this is not the case, and manipulability theoriescanbereconciledwithregularitytheoriesbynotingthatamanipu- latedcauseissimplyonecomponentof(1)withuunknown(somecompo- nentsofumaybeunknownandotherssimplynotobserved).Toillustrate thispointusing(1),supposethetreatmentvariablesis0(notreatment)or1 (treatment),x2(cid:2) andu2(cid:2) ¼ (cid:2) [(cid:2) ,with(cid:2) (cid:2) ¼ ;.Suppose x u 0u 1u 0u 1u thatfor(x,u) 2 (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:2) , g (x, u) ¼ g (x, u) ¼ 0, while for (x, u) 2 x 0u 0 1 (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:2) , g (x, u) ¼ 0, g (x, u) ¼ 1. In a manipulability theory, the x 1u 0 1 variable s is singled out for attention. If the investigator knows (s, x, u) and the functions g, the effect of s varies over x and u in a known s (to the investigator) way. In practice, the investigator observes only s andx,inwhichcasetheeffectofs(whichtheinvestigatormaynotbe able to identify from data) varies over x in an apparently nondeter- ministic manner.</p>
<p>The relativity of causation (part of what Heckman calls the provisional nature of causal knowledge) is also easily illustrated. In (1) the treatment variable s may be singled out for attention and manipulated. The other arguments (x and u) remain in the causal background. A different investigator might identify one or more components of x (cid:3) (x , x ) as the cause and rewrite (1) as h 1 2 x1 (x , u, s).</p>
<p>2 When the cause can be manipulated, each unit in a research study can receive any of the various levels of the cause (even though in practice a given unit is observed only at one level). In his presentation of what has come to be known in the statistical community as ‘‘Rubin’s model for causal inference,’’ Holland (1986), like Heckman, also emphasizes the importance of mani- pulating the cause, going so far as to coin the (unfortunate) phrase, ‘‘No causation without manipulation.’’ Whereas Holland appears to insist on the actual ability of an investigator to manipulate the cause(s), many others, including Heckman, have argued that it is the idea of manipulating the cause, even if this can only be done hypothetically, that is key in defining causal relation- ships.Ifthispointofviewistaken(butnotifnot),Hollandappearsto be conflating the distinct problems of defining and identifying causal effects.</p>
<p>treatmentofcausalityishisclaimthat‘‘causalityisinthemind.’’This claimstemsfrom(a)thefactthatcausaleffectsaredefinedaschanges in outcomes when variables in a model are (hypothetically) manipu- lated and (b) the view that models are mental constructs made up by the scientist, ‘‘not empirical statements or descriptions of actual worlds’’ (page 3). While Heckman’s conclusion is consistent with (a) and (b), and Heckman is certainly free to define causality in this fashion, I do not believe that most scientists (or philosophers) would subscribe to this view, and were they to do so, they would presumablyhavelittlefurtherinterestincausality(assciencetypically purports to be concerned with the real world).</p>
<p>In this vein, models (be they mathematical or of some other sort) are often constructed by scientists to represent causal processes (causalmechanisms)believedtobeoperating inthe actualworld(not justthemind).Tobesure,themodelshavetobeimaginedandinthis sense, our notion of the causal process(es) at play comes from the mind, but the processes (which wemay or may notaccurately model) are also believed to reside in the actual world. That is, the causal relation is typically held to describe a relation that is believed to exist in the real world.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>DEFINING CAUSAL ESTIMANDS In the statistical literature on causal inference, as in Heckman, assumptions (A-1) and (A-2) are typically made; Rubin (1980) has called this the stable unit treatment value assumption (SUTVA).</li>
</ol>
<p>Whentheseassumptionsarenotmade,theproblemofdefiningcausal estimands is more difficult, as is the problem of making inferences about these. In addition to Heckman, several others have worked on this problem (Halloran and Struchiner 1995; Sobel 2001, 2003). But this is fertile ground for social scientists, where interference due to social interactions and other constraints are the norm. Nevertheless, following Heckman, I shall hereafter assume SUTVA holds.</p>
<p>With (A-1) and (A-2) in hand, the response of unit ! to level s ofthecausemaybewrittenasY(!);forthepurposesathand,assume s that each unit can take on every level of the cause. Individual (unit) causal effects are then defined as an intra-unit, between-treatment observed only under one treatment, it is not possible to observe unit causal effects. Holland (1986) refers to this fact as ‘‘the fundamental problem of causal inference.’’ Heckman focuses attention on three estimands in this paper, theaveragecausaleffect(ACE),theeffectoftreatmentonthetreated (TT), and the marginal treatment effect (MTE). Although the MTE can be useful for understanding other estimators, I do not discuss it further herein, asI believe sociologists will usually be more interested in the other two estimands. The local average treatment effect (LATE) will be discussed subsequently.</p>
<p>LetSdenoteasetoftreatmentsofinterest.Theaveragecausal effect of treatment s versus s0 (ACE(s, s0)) is defined as EðY (cid:4)Y Þ; ð2Þ s s0 in which h(Y (!), Y (!)) ¼ (Y (!) (cid:4) Y (!)). The ACE can also be s s0 s s0 definedconditionallyoncovariatesW;asinHeckman,thisisdenoted ACE(s, s0 j W), and when it is obvious which treatments are being compared (as in the case where there is just one treatment compared tonotreatment)simplyACE(W),orACEinthecasewherethereare no covariates. Since, following Heckman, Y (!) is defined as the out- s come of unit ! when treatment s is received, herein the ACE is the average difference when all units receive treatment s as versus s0. It is also(byvirtueofassumptions(A-1)and(A-2)),theeffectofreceiving treatment s versus s0 for a randomly selected person from the population.</p>
<p>Theaverageeffectoftreatmentsversuss0onthetreated(TT(s,s0)) is another parameter of longstanding interest: EððY (cid:4)Y ÞjD¼sÞ; ð3Þ s s0 where D is the random variable denoting which treatment in S is actually received. Thus, TT(s, s0) is the average effect of treatment s versus s0 for those units that actually take up treatment s.</p>
<p>To round out the discussion, I also want to consider a para- meter that has received a great deal of attention from biostatisticians and the public health community, the so called ‘‘intent to treat’’ estimand (ITT(s, s0)). For all s 2 S, we define Y~(!) as the outcome s subject is assigned may differ from the treatment received because subjects will not always take up the treatment to which they are assigned; thus Y~(!) 6¼ Y(!) in general.) ITT(s, s0) is then defined s s by (2) with Y~ and Y~ replacing Y and Y , respectively. Note that in s s0 s s0 the case where all subjects would take up their assignments, for any possible assignment, Y~(!) ¼ Y (!) and ITT(s, s0) ¼ ACE(s, s0).</p>
<p>s s Therehasbeensomecontroversyoverwhichoftheparameters aboveareofgreatestinterest.Itaketheviewthatitalldependsonthe problem at hand, the goals of the scientist(s) analyzing the data and the purposes of the person(s) making policy on the basis of the analysis. Some examples where one or more of the parameters above are of interest follow.</p>
<p>Forpolicieswithuniversalcoverageanduniversalparticipation, theACEistheobviousparameterofinterest.Forexample,considerthe effect of a specific currency devaluation (s ¼ 0 if no devaluation, 1 otherwise)onhouseholdspending.HereY~(!) ¼ Y(!)forall!,imply- s s ingACE ¼ ITT.Ifthedevaluationisimplemented,ACE ¼ TTaswell (aseveryunittakesupthetreatment).</p>
<p>For policies with universal coverage that do not require parti- cipation, some units may not take up the treatment. Because non- participating units will not obtain the benefits of participation, it might be argued that knowing the average effect of treatment for these units is irrelevant, suggesting TT is the parameter of interest.</p>
<p>However, the untreated might take up treatment in the future if they believed the treatment were effective (for them). Thus, we might wish to also know the TUT (effect of treatment on the untreated).</p>
<p>Alternatively, policymakers might want to know the effect for the nonparticipatingunits,forifthisisdeemedsubstantial,theywillthen want to make efforts to obtain the participation of such units. They will then also want to know the ACE, which is a weighted average of the TT and the effect of treatment on the untreated (TUT).</p>
<p>But some might argue instead that the effect that should be of interestistheeffectofofferingtheprogram.Forexample,considerthe case of a new contraceptive method. Whereas some scientists may be moreinterestedintheACE(orpossiblytheTT),whichmeasuresmore directly the clinical effectiveness of the contraceptive, policymakers considering whether or not to widely distribute the contraceptive in a developing country are more concerned with the cost and the efficacy instructions). Consequently, they are more interested in the ITT.</p>
<p>Finally, it is worth noting that if receipt of treatment is inde- pendentofthepotentialoutcomes,givenasetofknowncovariatesW (includingthe caseofnocovariates),TT(W) ¼ TUT(W) ¼ ACE(W).</p>
<p>Heckman also discusses a number of outcome measures that may be of interest to social scientists and economists but which are not discussed in the statistical literature he criticizes, where the out- comes Y (!) are typically straightforward measures of the status of a s unit—for example, the income of a family under treatment s or the survival time of a subject after surgery. In particular, Heckman con- siders outcomes V(Y (!)) where V is some function of the outcome— s for example, the utility of Y (!) to individual ! (or to a policymaker) s under policy s. He then uses these to define various parameters comparing the benefit (welfare) associated with alternative policies.</p>
<p>Although mathematically nothing new is involved here, this is useful, especially because it is possible that E(V(Y ) (cid:4) V(Y )) (cid:5) 0 when s s0 (2) &gt; 0, for example. Thus, if V were to measure a social planner’s utility, the planner would not wish to choose policy s over s0 even thoughtheaveragecausaleffectisgreaterthan0.Choosingapolicyis often not this simple, however; for some interesting recent work that applies decision theory to the problem of treatment choice, see Manski (2000, 2004).</p>
<p>The estimands above are differences between means. Because the integral is a linear operator, these estimands only require knowl- edge of the marginal distributions F(y) and F(y 0) of potential s s outcomes.Undersomecircumstances(discussedlater),thesedistribu- tions can be identified.</p>
<p>(cid:2) (cid:3) Heckmanalsodiscussesanumberofotherestimandsh Y ;Y0 s s (cid:2) (cid:3) of substantive interest that depend on the joint distribution F y ;y0 s s of ðY ;Y Þ. However, the fundamental problem of causal inference s s0 precludes the simultaneous observation of Y(!) and Y0ð!Þ, implying s s that it is not possible to know more than the marginal distributions.</p>
<p>And while knowledge of the marginal distributions imposes some constraints on the joint distribution, these constraints often do not allow much useful information on the joint to be extracted (for example, if the marginals are normal with known means and var- iances, this is consistent with non-normal joint distributions, as well as a bivariate normal with any correlation between (cid:4)1 and 1). Thus, estimate parameters depending on the joint distribution of potential outcomes than parameters depending only on the marginal distribu- tion of the potential outcomes (for an example of this, see Carneiro, Hansen and Heckman 2003). Since the data impose few constraints (as discussed above) and the joint distribution of potential outcomes is not even an explicit auxiliary consideration in any substantive theory I can think of, the possibility that mathematical assumptions made primarily for the sake of convenience or tractability may be in large measure generating the ‘‘empirical’’ results seems especially strong here; sensitivity analyses should be a must.</p>

<li>POLICY EVALUATION AND FORECASTING Drawing upon themes exposited at greater length in Heckman (2000,</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2001" type="1">
<li>and several subsequent papers, Heckman emphasizes the value of the ‘‘scientific approach’’ (as exemplified by structural models) for policy evaluation and forecasting. He distinguishes three problems:</li>
</ol>
<ol type="1">
<li>evaluating policies that have been implemented, (2) extrapolation of these to new environments, and (3) forecasting the effects of policies that have not been implemented to new environments.</li>
</ol>
<p>Heckman uses a structural equation model of the form (cid:2)(X(!), U(!)) to examine this problem, writing the expectation of the observedoutcome Y in the historical population, conditional on X as Z E ðYjX¼xÞ¼ (cid:2)ðx;uÞdF ðujxÞ; ð4Þ H H U whereF (u j x)istheconditionaldistributionofUgivenX ¼ xinthe H historicalpopulation.Forproblem2,wewanttoknowE (Y j X ¼ x).</p>
<p>T It is clear from equation (4) that this problem is easily solved if the distribution F (u j X ¼ x) is known in the new environment (target), T assuming also the invariance of (cid:2) and the condition that the support of(X,U)inthetargetpopulationiscontainedinthesupportof(X,U) in thehistorical population.Of course,the assumptions andinforma- tion needed to solve this problem are very strong. The third problem canbedealtwith inasimilarfashion(see theappendixtoHeckman’s paper), although it is more complicated.</p>
<p>inference has focused on estimating the impact of policies in a given environment and problems 2 and 3 have not received much explicit attention. But certainly problem 2 is easy to address within the usual ‘‘treatment effect’’ framework and perhaps this is why it has not been addressed explicitly; problem 3 I discuss momentarily.</p>
<p>Inowproceedtodiscussproblem2withina‘‘treatmenteffects’’ framework forseveral reasons. First, I want the reader tounderstand that the ‘‘treatment effects’’ framework and the ‘‘scientific’’ frame- work, despite apparent differences, often yield very similar answers torealquestions.Inparticular,thatmustbethecasewhenweseethat the answers actually rest on similar assumptions, once these are exposited. Second, in comparing Heckman’s structural approach with the alternative I exposit below, I believe that some researchers who might need to address this problem in their future substantive work may find it easier to think about this problem from the ‘‘treat- ment effects’’ perspective.</p>
<p>For the sake of concreteness, consider the problem of extra- polating the historical ACE E (Y (cid:4) Y ) to a new population H 1 0 T. The obvious thing to do is to think of a set of covariates Z such that the historical and target ACEs are identical, and to average the historical ACE over the marginal distribution of Z in the target population.</p>
<p>More formally (assuming Y and Y are real valued scalars), 1 0 the conditional ACE in the target population is Z Z E ððY (cid:4)Y ÞjZ¼zÞ¼ y dF ðy jzÞ(cid:4) y dF ðy jzÞ: ð5Þ T 1 0 1 T 1 0 T 0 R R Knowledge of the target distributions F (y j z) and F (y j z) is T 0 T 1 sufficient to determine the value of equation (5); of course, the pro- blem is that target distributions are unknown and it might be very difficulttospecifythem.Thesimplestthingistoassumethehistorical and target distributions are the same (where these are both defined) F (y j z) ¼ F (y j z) for s ¼ 0, 1. Alternatively, in this case, we H s T s might just as well assume the weaker condition E ((Y (cid:4) Y ) j T 1 0 Z ¼ z) ¼ E ((Y (cid:4) Y ) j Z ¼ z). Either of these is an invariance H 1 0 assumption and should not be lightly made. But this characterization and this should allow an investigator to think reasonably about the necessary components of Z. Continuing, the target ACE is then Ð E (Y (cid:4) Y ) ¼ (E ((Y (cid:4) Y ) j z)dF (z). Of course, to average T 1 0 R H 1 0 T the integrand over the target distribution, it must be defined for all values (up to a set of probability measure 0) that Z takes on in the target population. This will be the case, for example, when the sup- ports of (Y, Z) in the target population are contained in the supports s of (Y, Z) in the historical population.</p>
<p>s Now suppose Y is, as in Heckman, the invariant (over the s historical and target population) structural equation; Y ¼ (cid:2) (Z, U ) s s s for s ¼ 0, 1, then Z E ðY jZ¼zÞ¼ (cid:2) ðz;u ÞdF ðu jzÞ: ð6Þ T s s s T s R Analogous to the case above, if the target distributions F (u j z) and F (u j z) are known, the value of (6) is known. If T 0 T 1 these are assumed to be identical to their historical counterparts, thisimpliesF (y j z) ¼ F (y j z)fors ¼ 0,1; ifsomeotherassump- H s T s tion is made, this cannot be the case. Note also that F (y j z) ¼ F (y j z) for s ¼ 0, 1 does not imply invariance of the H s T s structural equation model nor the conditional distributions of U. As s before, the ACE is obtained by averaging over the marginal distribu- tion of Z in the target population.</p>
<p>As for the second point, I at least find it easier to think about the distributions F (y j z) (or the conditional ACE) than to think T s aboutinvariantstructuralequationsandtheconditionaldistributions of the unobservables. (Of course, this does not invalidate a structural approach.) Heckman is also very critical of the ‘‘treatment effects litera- ture’’ for its failure to deal with problem P3, and he briefly (see some of Heckman’s more recent work with Vytlacil for a more detailed treatment) considers this problem here, suggesting that treatments be viewed as a bundle of characteristics. The relationship between these characteristics (as versus just the treatments themselves) and the response (possibly with covariates) can then be modeled, and the relationship transported to the new environment, as per problem P2.</p>
<p>which makes one wonder why statisticians have not addressed this topic. In that regard, several points are in order.</p>
<p>First, formorethan75years, statisticiansand appliedworkers have been using factorial experiments in conjunction with Fisher’s analysis of variance (and more generally, response surface meth- odology) to both identify and estimate the effects of the factors (characteristics) comprising the treatment on the response, and to extrapolate these to conditions not actually experienced. A simple example is a partial factorial design, where higher order interactions are assumed to be 0, allowing extrapolation to combinations of the components not actually observed.</p>
<p>The solution above to problem P3 will be inadequate when the effects of the factors vary by covariates whose distributions are different in the historical and target population. In this case, it would be necessary to estimate the effects conditionally and then average over the distribution of these in the target population, as above. Conceptually, this is straightforward. Practically, the pro- blem is to know what covariates to use and the relationship between the effects of the factors and the covariates. In the sim- plest case, where the investigator really does know what covariates to use and the covariates take on only a few levels, it may not be necessary to introduce (possibly arbitrary) modeling assumptions about the relationship between the effects of the factors and the covariates to make headway. But when there are many covariates and/or several continuous covariates, such assumptions become necessary.</p>
<p>There are two matters that make for additional complexity and the need for yet more assumptions. In observational studies, treatment assignment may not be ignorable. If it is ignorable, given known covariates, one can (in theory) proceed as above. If not, other avenuesmustbeconsideredtoachieveidentificationofparametersof interest.</p>
<p>Finally and perhaps critically, in contrast to the case in the experimental design literature, in most observational studies and social experiments, the number of characteristics an investigator would like to consider may far exceed the number of treatment groups. This will make for identification problems and point identifi- cation may end up resting on a number of assumptions that are observational study where it is reasonable to assume treatment assign- ment is ignorable (without covariates) and the average effects do not depend on covariates whose distributions differ in the historical and target populations. In this case, transporting the relationship between theresponseanditscomponentstothenewenvironmentissimple,once therelationshipisdetermined.Supposenowthereare5components,each having2values(i.e.,thereare32combinationsofcomponentvalues);to identifyalltheeffects inthemostgeneral case, 32treatmentgroupsare needed.Evenifmanyofthehigherorderinteractionsdisappear,identi- ficationproblemswillremainiftherearefewtreatmentgroups,asinthe usual case.

<li>IDENTIFYING AND ESTIMATING CAUSAL EFFECTS 5.1.

<p>Under complete randomization the set of potential outcomes where A is the treatment assignment variable and the notation is used to denote statistical independence. (Note that A refers to the treatment assigned, which may not be the treatment actually received.) Letting Y~ denote the observed response, under (7), E(Y~ j A ¼ s) ¼ E(Y~ j A ¼ s) ¼ E(Y~); thus, the observable condi- s s tional expectations identify the parameter ITT(s, s0).</p>
<p>The completely randomized experiment is a special case of the conditionally randomized experiment in which subjects are first grouped according to a set W of pretreatment covariates, and a completely randomized experiment is then conducted within the groups. Under conditional randomization, treatment assignment is ‘‘ignorable’’ given the covariates W: ðfY~ g ÞkAjW: ð8Þ s s2S Consequently, ITT(s, s0 j W) is identified from the observable condi- tional expectations: EðY~ (cid:4)Y~ jWÞ¼EðY<sub>jA¼s;WÞ(cid:4)EðY</sub>jA¼s0;WÞ: ð9Þ s s0 Rubin (1977, 1978) saw that the conditionally randomized study provides a means to bridge the gap between experimental and observational studies. In observational studies, it is often not reason- able to believe the ignorability assumption: ðfY g ÞkD: ð10Þ s s2S However, if covariates W can be found that determine the treatment receipt process (in the sense that given these covariates, receipt of treatment does not depend on the potential outcomes), treatment assignment is ignorable, given the covariates (Barnow, Cain and Goldberger 1980 dubbed this ‘‘selection on observables’’):1 1Editor’s Note: This sentence is misprinted. The latter part of this sentence should read as follows: ‘‘… treatment assignment is ignorable, given the covariates (Barnow, Cain and Goldberger 1980).

<p>By way of contrast, despite a longstanding interest in making causal statements, until more recently economists were less interested in experimental data than statisticians. In part, this is due to the fact that economists are interested in many questions that are not parti- cularly amenable to experimentation.</p>
<p>Economists have also long recognized that human agents make choicesandtheyusetheoriesofrationaldecisionmakingtocharacterize the manner in which agents choose among alternatives. That is, econo- mistsattempttocarefullyconsideronesetofmechanismsthatindividuals might use to allocate themselves to treatments (how agents choose D).</p>
<p>Further,thisallocationprocessisoftenofintrinsicinteresttoeconomists.</p>
<p>Heckmancharacterizesthestatisticalliteratureasincomplete,in part because statisticians do not model the allocation process. An example of this is adjusting for covariates using regression analysis, longadvocatedbystatisticians.Heremodelingtheconditionalexpecta- tion E(Y j W, D) alone leads to an estimate of (12). If interest resides solelyinestimating(12)when(11) holds,thereisnoneedtomodelthe allocation process. But even when (11) holds, especially in an observa- tional study where W may be a large vector, statisticians will often advocate modeling the allocation process to reduce the dimensionality of the estimation problem, a subject to which I shall return.</p>
<p>Nevertheless,thefocusinthestatisticalliteratureisprimarilyon obtainingthebestpossibleestimateofthecausalparameterofinterest.</p>
<p>randomized experiment and an observational study where units select their own treatment, the experiment is typically preferred (especially when ITT is the parameter ofinterest and/or ACE is the parameter of interest and subjects comply with their assignments (that is, for all ! and for all s 2 S, subject ! takes up assignment s when assigned to s).</p>
<p>Ingeneral,thewayinwhichunitsareallocatedintheexperiment will not reflect the real-world allocation mechanism where human agents are making choices, as studied by economists. As such, the opportunity to learn about this mechanism (at least from the experi- mentalstudy)isgivenup.Thisisthepricewepaytoensure(7)or(8).</p>
<p>In the observational study, however, we cannot be certain that allrelevantcovariateshavebeentakenintoaccount.If(11)holdsand the regression function is modeled correctly, we can learn about both the allocation process and the causal parameter(s) of interest. But if one or more covariates have not been taken into account and (11) is assumed,credibleestimatesofcausalparametersmaynotbeobtained.</p>
<p>As Heckman points out, individuals making decisions may have rele- vantinformationthatisnotaccessibletotheinvestigatorandtherefore such information cannot be included in the investigator’s model of the agent’s choice. In economic models of behavior, agents use this ‘‘hidden’’ information in computing the expected utility of different choices. The agent then makes the choice that maximizes expected utility. Since it is not unreasonable to suppose that utility is a mono- tonefunctionofmanyofthetypesofoutcomes(forexample,earnings) studied by economists, in such circumstances (11) will in general not be satisfied for the set of pretreatment covariates accessible to the investigator, and (12) will then not hold. In this case, if (11) is (correctly) not assumed for a given set of available covariates W, credibleestimatesmightbeobtainedusingothermethods—forexam- ple, fixed effects models (including differences in differences), control functions, instrumental variables. But if the assumptions underlying the use of these alternatives are incorrect in the application under consideration,thenasbefore,credibleestimatesmaynotbeobtained.</p>
<p>5.2. Matching, Control Functions, and Instrumental Variables These are three approaches to estimating causal parameters.</p>
<p>Interestingly, although the rationale and assumptions needed to figures prominently in all three.</p>
<p>In observational studies where it is believed that (11) holds, therestillremainstheproblemofestimatingE(Y j W,D).WhenWis a high-dimensional vector and/or several components have many values, it may be difficult to specify the form of this function cor- rectly, which can lead to faulty inferences. Matching will also be problematic in this case.</p>
<p>Let S ¼ {0,1}. In a key paper, Rosenbaum and Rubin (1983) showed that when (11) holds and 0&lt;PrðD¼1jWÞ&lt;1; ð13Þ then ðfY g ÞkDÞjPðWÞ; ð14Þ s s2S 0&lt;PrðD¼1jPðWÞÞ&lt;1; ð15Þ where P(W) ¼ Pr(D ¼ 1 j W) is the ‘‘so called’’ propensity score.</p>
<p>Imbens (2000) generalizes the notion of a propensity score to the case of finitely many treatments. Imai and van Dyk (2004) extend thenotionofapropensityscoretothemoregeneralcasewhereDmay take on infinitely many values.</p>
<p>As a consequence of (15), EðY (cid:4)Y ÞjPðWÞÞ¼EðYjD¼1;PðWÞÞ(cid:4)EðYjD¼0;PðWÞÞ: ð16Þ 1 0 Equation (16) provides the mathematical justification for matching on the one-dimensional propensity score (as opposed to the multidimen- sionalvectorW,whichmaywellbesparse),inwhichobservationswith thesamevaluesofP(W)—one withD ¼ 1, the other withD ¼ 0—are randomly paired, their difference providing an unbiased estimate of (16).Anunbiasedestimateoftheparameter(2)canthenbeformedby taking the appropriate weighted average. Equation (16) can also be used to justify a related method called subclassification and to justify covariance adjustment using only D and P(W) (as versus D and W).</p>
<p>Other parameters (for example, TT) can also be estimated using these and related methods. The interested reader might wish to consult Smith (1997) for a sociological application and Imbens (2004) for a nice overview of estimating average treatment effects under the assumption (11).</p>
<p>The beauty of matching is explained quite nicely by Heckman (page65,thisvolume)andinHeckmanandNavarro-Lozano(2004:33): matching ‘‘does not require separability of outcome or choice equa- tions into observable and unobservable components, exogeneity of conditioning variables, exclusion restrictions or adoption of specific functionalformsofoutcomeequations.’’Othermethodsofestimating causal effects, such as instrumental variables, fixed effects, and con- trolfunctions,normallyrequireoneormoreassumptionsoftheform above.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Heckman is quite critical of matching on the propensity score. First, the method breaks down if P(W) ¼ 0 or 1 for one or more values of W. In practice, even in less extreme cases, an investigator may encounter the case where the estimated P(W) is close to, for example, 1 and there are no ‘‘good’’ matches from the control group. When such data are excluded, as is often the case, the causal parameter that is actually estimated (an average effect on a common support) may be of less interest. Second, when P(W) is unknown (the typical case) and it is estimated nonparametrically, the dimensionality problem is simply transferred to this estimation problem.</p>
<p>Heckman also argues that it is often difficult to justify the use of (11) for some conditioning set W. According to him, this situation isexacerbatedbytheabsenceofanexplicitmodeloftreatmentchoice.</p>
<p>Finally, he states that (11) is quite strong substantively, implying MTE(W) ¼ ACE(W) ¼ TT(W).</p>
<p>Ofcourse,itcanbearguedthat(14)mayholdevenif(11)does not. But it is difficult to think of substantive situations where we would want to argue that (14) holds and hence that (16) holds but (11) does not. We should note also that (12) may hold even if (11) does not hold, and that (16) can hold even if (14) does not. However, as above, it is difficult to think of instances where we would want to argue that one of the weaker conditions holds, but the stronger does not. Thus, I do not consider it worthwhile to further entertain argu- ments of this nature.</p>
<p>contexts.Hesuggeststhatwhenagentshavehunchesaboutthevalues of the potential outcomes, and treatment choice is based on those hunches, assumption (11) will not hold. While often true, there may nevertheless be situations where an investigator knows and measures the covariates on which the agents’ decisions are based, in which case (11) holds. See also Imbens (2004) for less trivial examples.</p>
<p>When investigators do not think carefully about the treatment assignment process in observational studies, they are likely to omit important covariates from consideration. That said, it is not the statistician’s job to substantively justify a particular model of choice.</p>
<p>Norwoulditbecorrecttosuggestthatstatisticiansareignorantof,or do not stress the importance of understanding the treatment assign- ment mechanism. Indeed, going back to Fisher (quoted in Cochran 1965) statisticians have long acknowledged the importance of having a good theory of the treatment assignment mechanism; see also Rosenbaum (2002, ch.&nbsp;1), who pays a great deal of attention to this matter.) Rosenbaum and others (see Rosenbaum [2002] for further citations) have also studied the consequences due to the failure to adjust for relevant omitted covariates.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, even when an investigator pays very close atten- tion to the treatment assignment mechanism, a covariate (set of covariates) known to be relevant may be missing from the data and/ orsomerelevantcovariatesareunknowntotheinvestigator.Thiswill bethecaseinsomeinstanceswheretreatmentassignmentistheresult of an economic agent behaving rationally and in other instances where some other process describes the allocation to treatment groups. Unfortunately, assumption (11) is not directly testable, though it may be possible, by introducing auxiliary assumptions, to test this indirectly. Heckman’s Tables 2 and 3 simply demonstrate what they should: if the assumptions underlying the use of matching are incorrect and the assumptions underlying Heckman’s particular example of the use of control functions are correct, the observable parameters that also equal TT and ACE in the case where matching hold are now biased for TT and ACE. When it is suspected that (11) does not hold, an investigator can attempt to conduct sensitivity analyses (as statisticians have long advocated), construct bounds on the parameter(s) of interest—for example, Manski (1990) and Robins (1989)—or use some other approach—for example, fixed effects, parameter of interest.</p>
<p>Following Heckman, I now examine the method of control functions, expositing the additively separable case also considered by him. He assumes (his equations 22a–22c) V¼(cid:3) ðWÞþU ; EðU jWÞ¼0; ð17Þ V V V Y ¼(cid:3) ðXÞþU ; EðU jX¼0Þ; ð18Þ s s s s where s ¼ 0 or 1 and D ¼ 1 if and only if V &gt; 0.</p>
<p>The observable conditional expectations (Y ¼ Y if D ¼ 1, Y 1 0 if D ¼ 0) are (using 18) EðYjX;Z;D¼sÞ¼(cid:3) ðXÞþEðU jX;Z;DÞ: ð19Þ s s Under assumption (18), when (11) holds (with (X, Z) ¼ W), E(Y j X, Z, D ¼ s) ¼ E(Y j X, Z) ¼ (cid:3)(X). Note that the first equality s s followsfrom(11)andthesecondfromtheadditionalassumption(18);that is,theadditionalassumption(18)isnotneededtojustifymatchingonthe propensityscore.Inthemethodofcontrolfunctions,however,assumption (11) is not made and the components E(U j X, Z, D ¼ s) are modeled.</p>
<p>s Notethat E(U j X, Z, D ¼ 1) ¼ E(U j X, Z, V &gt; 0) ¼ E(U j X, Z, 1 1 1 U &gt; (cid:4)(cid:3) (Z)) by virtue of assumption (17); similarly, E(U j X, Z, V V 0 D ¼ 0) ¼ E(U j X,Z,V (cid:5) 0).Thus,under(17) and(18),itmightseem 0 that the method of control functions is more general than matching. But modeling E(U j X, Z, D ¼ s) will require additional assumptions—for s example, Heckman’s assumption (C-1): (U , U , U )??(X, Z).</p>
<p>1 0 V Assumption (C-1) implies (U , U ??(X, Z) j U , so that E(U j X, Z, 1 0 V s D ¼ s)dependsonX,ZonlythroughthepropensityscoreP(X,Z).As inmatching,aprobleminvolvinghighdimensionalityisnowreducedto aone-dimensionalproblemthroughtheuseofthepropensityscore.Itis worthnotingthatassumption[C-1]doesnotimply(11).Nordoes(11) imply(C-1).Thus,evenif(17)and(18)hold,itisnotthecasethat‘‘the controlfunctionapproachismoregeneralthanthematchingapproach’’ (page 73, this volume). (Heckman points out that assumption (C-1) is not essential. Nevertheless, if this assumption is removed, others will tionsandwillthusbeusefulindifferentcircumstances.</p>
<p>One other point should be made. Heckman notes: ‘‘Without invoking parametric assumptions, the method of control functions requires an exclusion restriction (a variable in Z that is not in X) to achieve nonparametric identification.’’ But he is far less critical of these assumptions (and others noted above) than he is of those required to justify matching and the use of instrumental variables.</p>
<p>In that vein, Vella (1998, p.&nbsp;131) points out the sensitivity to para- metricassumptionsofHeckman’soriginalwork:‘‘Asestimationrelies heavily on the normality assumption, the estimates are inconsistent if normality fails.’’ Vella (1998, p.&nbsp;135) also notes that the exclusion restriction is ‘‘controversial’’ and he argues that many theoretical economic models of behavior, including the Roy model discussed by Heckman, explicitly impose Z ¼ X.</p>
<p>Usinginstrumentalvariablesisanotherwaytoestimatetreatment effectsinobservationalstudies,anditmakesassumptionsthataredifferent than those made in matching or the method of control functions.</p>
<p>Social scientists have long used instrumental variables to estimate treat- ment effects when treatment choice is ‘‘endogenous.’’ Traditionally, the techniqueisexpositedasfollows.Considertheregression Y¼(cid:3)ðXÞþ(cid:4)Dþ”; ð20Þ where D ¼ 1 if the treatment is received, 0 otherwise, (cid:4) is the desired treatment effect, and E(” j X) ¼ 0. The problem here is that D is correlated with “, so in general E(” j X, D) 6¼ 0 (equivalently, E(Y j X, D) ¼ (cid:3)(X) þ (cid:4)D þ E(” j X, D)). However, if a variable Z canbeobtainedthatisassociatedwithYonlythroughD,i.e., Zdoes not directly affect the outcome, E(” j X, Z) ¼ E(” j X) ¼ 0, in which case E(Y j X, Z) ¼ (cid:3)(X) þ (cid:4)E(D j X, Z). Consequently (assuming E(D j X, Z ¼ 1) (cid:4) E(D j X, Z ¼ 0) 6¼ 0), EðYjX;Z¼1Þ(cid:4)EðYjX;Z¼0Þ (cid:4) ¼ : ð21Þ EðDjX;Z¼1Þ(cid:4)EðDjX;Z¼0Þ From a causal standpoint, the formulation above is quite vague. Heckman has helped to clarify the literature on instrumental variables. Angrist, Imbens, and Rubin (1996) is another paper that I Heckman’s.Thus,Ibrieflyexpositthisapproachandsubsequentlytie it to the exposition in Heckman; see also Vytlacil (2002).</p>
<p>I will focus on several parameters discussed by Heckman (ACE(X)), the local average treatment effect (hereafter LATE(X)), TT(X), and I will also briefly discuss ITT(X). Following Heckman, Z is the instrumentalvariable. It will also betaken tobe binary,as in Angrist et al.&nbsp;(1996). (See Angrist and Imbens [1995] for some gen- eralizationsofthesetupconsideredherein.)LetZ(previouslydenoted A)denotethetreatmenttowhichasubjectisassigned(0ifassignedto the control group, 1 if assigned to the treatment group). Let D(!) denotetheobservedchoiceofunit(!)andletD (!)denotethechoice z unit ! makes when assigned to treatment z 2 {0, 1}. Similarly, let Y (!) denote the response of unit ! when that unit is assigned to (z,Dz) treatment z and chooses outcome D (!). (Previously, Y (!) was z (z,Dz) denoted Y~ (!).) Let Y (!) denote the outcome of unit ! when that z zs unitisassignedtotreatmentzand‘‘takesup’’treatments,forz ¼ 0,1, s ¼ 0, 1. Note that for each assignment, individuals take up only one treatment; nevertheless, as above, potential outcomes assuming they had taken up the treatment they did not take up can be defined.</p>
<p>To begin, it is useful to formalize the exclusion restriction— that is, the idea that the instrumental variable only affects the out- come by affecting D. This is the assumption (Holland 1988) Y ð!Þ¼Y ð!Þ ð22Þ ð0;sÞ ð1;sÞ for s ¼ 0, 1 and all !. Consequently, the potential outcomes may be writtenasY(!).Theexclusionrestrictionisverystrong,anditcanbe s quite difficult to find instruments that satisfy this assumption.</p>
<p>TheproblemwithestimatingtheeffectofD(conditionalonthe covariates X) on the outcome is that (11) will not generally hold, becauseDis‘‘endogenous’’;thus,ingeneral,E(Y j D ¼ s,X) ¼6 E(Y j X).</p>
<p>s However,if(8)holds(withZinplaceofA),aswouldbethecaseina randomized experiment, EðYjZ¼1;XÞ(cid:4)EðYjZ¼0;XÞ¼EðY (cid:4)Y jXÞ; ð23Þ 1;D1 0;D0 that is, ITT(X) is the numerator of the IV estimand (21). (Recall the previous discussion, which suggests that at least in some instances, policymaker.) Continuing, ITT(X) may be broken down into the following four components: EðY (cid:4)Y jXÞ¼EEððY (cid:4)Y ÞjD ;D ;XÞ; ð24Þ 1;D1 0;D0 1;D1 0;D0 0 1 where (D , D ) ¼ (0, 0) or (0, 1) or (1, 0) or (1, 1). By virtue of the 0 1 exclusion restriction (22), units who always take up the treatment (D (!) ¼ D (!) ¼ 1), hereafter called ‘‘always takers,’’ or never take 0 1 up the treatment (D (!) ¼ D (!) ¼ 0), hereafter called ‘‘never 0 1 takers,’’ contribute nothing to (24). Angrist et al.&nbsp;(1996) call subjects with D ¼ 1, D ¼ 0 compliers and subjects with D ¼ 0, D ¼ 1 1 0 1 0 defiers; only these two types of units contribute to (24) under the exclusion restriction.</p>
<p>Angrist et al.&nbsp;(1996) also assume there are no defiers (the monotonicity assumption), in which case ITTðXÞ¼EððY (cid:4)Y ÞjD ¼0;D ¼1;XÞPrðD ¼0;D ¼1jXÞ: ð25Þ 1;D1 0;D0 0 1 0 1 Dividing ITT(X) by the compliance probability (assuming this is greater than 0) gives the parameter LATE(X), the average treatment effect for the compliers (at X). The compliance probability Pr(D ¼ 1, 1 D ¼ 0 j X) &gt; 0 may also be written (under the assumptions 0 here) as E((D (cid:4) D ) j X). But this is equal to E(D j X, Z ¼ 1) (cid:4) 1 0 E(D j X, Z ¼ 0) when treatment assignment (Z) is ignorable, given X, as here. Thus, under the assumptions above, LATE(X) ¼ IV(X). Note alsothatthecomplianceprobabilitymaybewrittenasPr(D ¼ 1jX) 1 (cid:4) Pr(D ¼ 1 j X) ¼ P(X, 1) (cid:4) P(X, 0), which makes the connection 0 withthepropensityscoreevident.</p>
<p>The parameter LATE(X) (or LATE when there are no covari- ates X) will not always have policy implications of interest. To begin, thecompliersconstitutealatentsubpopulation.So,evenifwewanted toadministerthetreatmentonlytothecompliersanditwaspolitically feasible to do so, it is not possible to identify these individuals (in practice, we could model the probability of being a complier and administer the program to those deemed ‘‘most likely’’ to be compliers). Second, when the compliers are a ‘‘small’’ fraction of the population, it may be difficult to argue that the results are of great istheexcesscivilianmortality(between1974and1983)resultingfrom service in the Vietnam War (not the excess mortality among compliers). For men born in 1950, the compliers constitute only 15.9 percent of the population; technically, LATE only applies to this fraction of the population. In some applications, however, even if the compliers are a small fraction of the population, LATE (or LATE(X)) is nevertheless a parameter of great interest. This would be the case when it could be argued that the noncompliers, had they complied, would experience the same benefits as the compliers.</p>
<p>I return to this subject momentarily. Third, Heckman (1997) has also pointed out that LATE (LATE(X)) is an unusual parameter, insofar as its very definition depends on the instrumental variable chosen.</p>
<p>Thus,insomecases,LATE(X)and/orLATEmayidentifyaparameter with policy relevance (as when Z represents assignment under a parti- cular policy of interest), and in other cases it may not. For further discussion of LATE and other possible parameters of interest, see the discussion following Angrist et al.&nbsp;(1996) and Heckman (1997).</p>
<p>AlthoughtheparametersLATEandLATE(X)maynotalways be of great substantive interest, the methodological point is that the meaning of the IV estimand has been clarified (which has great substantive implications). In particular, a basis is provided that makes it very easy to ask if IV(X) identifies other parameters of possibly greater interest, such as TT(X) and ACE(X).</p>
<p>Toseethis,considertheparameterTT(X),whichconditionson receipt of treatment (D ¼ 1). The units receiving treatment are the compliersinthetreatmentgroupandthealwaystakers(stillassuming there are no defiers). It follows from the foregoing results that IV(X) 6¼ TT(X) in general, and that IV(X) ¼ TT(X) if and only if the average effect of receiving treatment for the always takers (assuming the probability of being an always taker is greater than 0) and compliers is the same. Put this way, an analyst can ask whether the equality of treatment effects across these two groups is a reason- ableassumptiontomake.Iftheanalystsuspects,forexample,thatthe always takers know that (even after conditioning on X) they will benefit by taking up the treatment (or have higher gains than others bysodoing),heorshewillnotwanttoassumeequalityacrossgroups and hence that IV(X) ¼ TT(X).</p>
<p>IV(X) must equal TT(X). If the treatment cannot be obtained in the control group, as in many social programs, it is not possible to be an alwaystaker.Inthiscase,LATE(X) ¼ TT(X)(withoutitbeingneces- sary to assume that the average effects of receiving treatment are the same for compliers and always takers), hence IV(X) ¼ TT(X).</p>
<p>Similarly,iftheaverageeffectofDontheresponseisthesame for compliers, always takers, and never takers, IV(X) ¼ LATE(X) ¼ TT(X) ¼ ACE(X). If it is not possible to be an always taker, LATE(X) ¼ TT(X) (as above) and LATE(X) ¼ ACE(X) (hence IV(X) ¼ ACE(X)) when it is assumed that the average effects of receiving treatment are identical for never takers and compliers. In cases where it is impossible to be a never taker (programs with universal coverage and participation), LATE(X) ¼ ACE(X) if it is assumed that the average effects of D on Y are identical for always takers and compliers.</p>
<p>InthecasewheretheuniteffectsofDonYarethesameforall !, the average effects of receiving treatment must be the same for all units, hence all groups, implying IV ¼ TT ¼ ACE. Of course, the assumption of constant effect is quite strong and not likely to be substantively reasonable in most social science applications.</p>
<p>Finally, if the probability of being a defier is nonzero, in general IV(X) 6¼ LATE(X); but in the special case where the average effect of receiving treatment for compliers and defiers is the same, IV(X) ¼ LATE(X).Angristet al.(1996)alsodiscusstheconsequences of violating the exclusion restriction, and there is some literature on estimating complier average causal effects in the absence of this restriction (for example, see, Jo [2002]).</p>
<p>Heckman approaches this subject somewhat differently. He imposes the additively separable model (18) on the potential out- comes. He then writes the observed outcome Y in terms of the potential outcomes as Y¼(cid:3) ðXÞþð(cid:3) ðXÞ(cid:4)(cid:3) ðXÞþU (cid:4)U ÞDþU ; ð26Þ 0 1 0 1 0 0 expresses the parameters TT(X) and ACE(X) in terms of (26), and states identifiability conditions in terms of D, U , and U .</p>
<p>0 1 The assumption of a constant effect holds (Y (cid:4) Y is the same 1 0 for all units) if U ¼ U (cid:3) U. In this case, the instrumental variable Z 0 1 under(18)E(Y j X,Z) ¼ E(Y j X)fors ¼ 0,1)).Asabove,asufficient s s condition for this is YkZ j X for s ¼ 0, 1, and as above, assuming s P(X,1) (cid:4) P(X,0) ¼6 0,IV(X) ¼ LATE(X) ¼ TT(X) ¼ ACE(X).</p>
<p>When the constant effect assumption fails but E(U (cid:4) U j X, 1 0 D ¼ 1) ¼ 0, Heckman (1997) shows that TT(X) ¼ ACE(X). A suffi- cient condition for this is ðU (cid:4)U ÞkDjX ð27Þ 1 0 (or more generally (Y (cid:4) Y )D j X). Though weaker than the condi- 1 0 tion (11), which was not presumed to hold, Heckman points out that the sufficient condition above is nevertheless quite strong, requiring thatreceiptoftreatmentnotdepend,givenX,ongainsanticipatedby subjects. That is, in general, we should not expect TT(X) ¼ ACE(X).</p>
<p>We can also see this from the results above, where it was established thatiftherearenodefiers,andtheaverageeffectofDontheresponse is identical for compliers and always takers, LATE(X) ¼ TT(X) ¼ ACE(X).Similarly,iftherearedefiersandtheaverageeffectofreceiving treatmentisidenticalfordefiersandcompliers,andforcompliersand always takers, LATE(X) ¼ TT(X) ¼ ACE(X).</p>
<p>Heckman also gives general conditions under which IV(X) ¼ TT(X) and IV(X) ¼ ACE(X). As in the simpler case above, and for the same reasons, Heckman argues that these conditions are quite strong.Again,thisargumentseemsmostcompellingwhentheanalyst doesnothave accesstodatathat thedecision makerisusing tomake his decision and this information is predictive of the potential out- comes.Forfurtherdetails,thereadermayconsultHeckman(1997)or his paper in this volume.</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>CONCLUSION Heckman argues for the use of an approach to causal inference in which structural models play a central role. It is worth remembering thatthesemodelsareoftenpowerfulinpartbecausetheymakestrong assumptions. When these assumptions are correct, powerful (and correct) inferences may be obtained. Such inferences are likely to be stronger than those that would be made by advocates of randomized tionalstudy,wemightlearn aboutthetreatmentassignment mechan- ism and various average effects, and we might extrapolate the results to a new policy in a new environment. But when the assumptions are arbitrarily invoked in applications or require the use of knowledge thattheinvestigatordoesnothave,asseemsoftenthecase,soarethe inferencesderivedfromsuchmodelingexercises.Thus,aninvestigator might well prefer to stick with simple estimators from randomized experiments,wheneverpossible.Insuchacase(presumingtheexperi- ment did not get botched and subjects complied with experimental protocols), the investigator can have greater confidence in his or her estimates of parameters such as ITT and ACE, for example.</li>
</ol>
<p>ButIdonotwanttoarguethatstructuralmodelingisnotuseful, nor do I want to suggest that methodologists should bear complete responsibility for the use of the tools they have fashioned. To my mind, both structural modeling and approaches that feature weaker assumptions have their place, and in some circumstances, one will be moreappropriatethantheother.Whichapproachismorereasonablein a particular case will often depend on the feasibility of conducting a randomizedstudy,whatwecanactuallysayaboutthereasonablenessof invoking various assumptions, as well as the question facingthe inves- tigator (which might be dictated by a third party, such as a policy- maker). An investigator’s tastes and preferences may also come into play. A cautiousandrisk-averse investigator maycareprimarilyabout beingright,evenifthislimitstheconclusionsheorshedraws,whereas another investigator who wants (or is required) to address a bigger questionmayhave(orneedtohave)agreatertoleranceforuncertainty aboutthevalidityofhisorherconclusions.</p>
<p>In his introductory section, Heckman claims to make two major points: (1) that ‘‘causality is a property of a model of hypothe- ticals’’ (page 2), and (2) that statisticians have conflated the distinct tasksofdefiningparametersofinterest,identification,andestimation.</p>
<p>Ihavealreadydiscussedthefirstpoint.Iconcludewithadiscussionof thesecond.Withrespecttothispoint,Heckmanwrites(page5):‘‘This emphasisonrandomizationoritssurrogates(likematching)rulesout a variety of alternative channels of identification of counterfactuals from population or sample data. It has practical consequences because of the conflation of step one with steps two and three in Table 1. Since randomization is used to define the parameters of zation is the only way—or at least the best way—to identify causal parameters from real data.’’ Heckman appears to be arguing here that statisticians are putting the cart before the horse by focusing interest on average causaleffectsthatdonotdependonthejointdistributionofpotential outcomes and emphasizing identification conditions in observational studies that parallel random assignment, thus justifying estimation methods such as matching and even randomization itself. While it is impossible to assess such a claim, it is worth noting that average causal effects such as the ACE and ITT have been of great interest in public health, for example, for many years. These parameters can and have been used to address policy questions that are of great interest. Recall also that both the potential outcomes notation and the ACE (Neyman 1923) preceded randomization.</p>
<p>Of course, Heckman is certainly correct to note that there are interestingestimandsthatdependonthejointdistributionandthathere, randomization is of considerably less help. In addition, as he and many othershavepointedout,whenitisimpossiblefortheinvestigatortoobtain a sufficiently rich set of covariates to condition on, other methods of identifying,andestimatingcausaleffects(includingtheusualeffectsthat donotdependonjointdistributionsofpotentialoutcomes)mustbeused.</p>
<p>But Heckman goes much further, arguing that statisticians have confounded the tasks of defining, identifying, and estimating causal parameters and, as above, even use randomization to define parameters of interest. By and large (except for some minor quibbles one might have about the way some authors have defined LATE), I would argue the opposite. One of the key contributions that statisti- cianshavemadeistounconfoundtheseissues,pavingthewayfor(1) the assessment of conditions under which valid causal inferences are permitted and (2) the development of appropriate methods for making valid causal inferences.</p>
<p>Consider the claim that randomization is used to define causal parametersofinterest.Intheintroduction,Istressedtheimportanceof good notation. By using the potential outcomes notation, statisticians (recall Neyman 1923 and later Rubin) were able to define causal esti- mandsthatmirroredtheirthinkingonthecounterfactualnatureofthe causal relation and that were different from the usual descriptive (observable)parameters.</p>
<p>under what conditions various observable parameters are equal to (identify) theseestimands.Randomizationisadeviceforassigningsub- jectstotreatmentsthatmakestheignorabilityassumptions(conditions) (8)and/or(11)plausible.Whentheseconditionshold,variousobservable parameters also equal the causal estimands. These conditions may also be met when randomization has not been used. This demonstrates the logical independence between the ignorability conditions and randomi- zation.Andclearly,theseconditionsarealsologicallyindependentofthe definitionsofcausalestimandssuchastheITT,ACE,andTT.(Readers mightalsowanttolookdirectlyatthedefinitionoftheseparametersand notethatnomentionofrandomizationismade.) More generally, defining causal estimands independently of the conditions that must be met in order to identify them allows for the development of appropriate procedures (including randomization, matching, IV, control functions, etc.) for identifying (and then estimating) the causal parameters. This is the approach taken in both the‘‘treatmenteffects’’literatureandrecenteconometricliteratures,and itisalsotheapproachthatHeckmantakes.Itisabigstepforward.</p>
<p>Another way to see the utility of making the definitions of causal effects logically independent of the conditions needed to iden- tify them is to consider the usual approach to regression analysis (or structural equation models) which is typically taken (both in the past and often even now) by many social scientists. The parameters of a regression are certainly interpretable in a descriptive sense, but social scientistsoftenimpartacausalinterpretationtooneormore(oftento all) parameters, which are typically interpreted as ‘‘effects’’ in this counterfactual sense (see Sobel [1990] for more on this point).</p>
<p>Justifications for such interpretations have included the notion that the model is well specified and/or that important confounders have beencontrolledand/orthatthecausalorderingiscorrect.Allofthese justifications are extra-mathematical and virtually impossible to eval- uate, insofar as a target (i.e., a well-defined estimand) has not even been defined. Using an appropriate notation allows the researcher to clearly define the estimand of interest independently of the regression parameter(s), enabling the analyst to give conditions under which the regression parameter(s) actually identify the target(s) of interest.</p>
<p>Although I disagree with him on this point and a number of others, Heckman, in conjunction with his collaborators, has made next generation of researchers will cooperate and incorporate the various literatures on causal inference, including the statistical and econometric literatures, under one umbrella. Science will be better served when this is the case.</p>
