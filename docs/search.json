    "text": "Abstract\nToward the end of his life, George Herbert Mead developed a theory of perspec- tives that may be used to reinterpret his social, developmental psychology. This paper attempts such a reinterpretation, leading to the emergence of a theory of perspective taking in early childhood that looks quite diff erent from that which is assumed in most extant work in developmental psychology. Theoretical and empirical implications of Mead’s perspectivism and perspective taking are also explored, with particular focus on questions of internalization and agency. In addition, important distinctions are drawn between Mead’s view of human development and most contemporary theories.\nCopyright © 2006 S. Karger AG, Basel\nVarious conceptions of internalization and agency can be found in the contem- porary literature of developmental psychology, but relatively little consensus has been achieved concerning their specifi c nature and role in the development of the minds and selves of human beings during ontogenesis [Chapman, 1999; Martin, Sugarman, & Thompson, 2003; Nicolopoulou & Weintraub, 1998]. Broadly speak- ing, internalization refers to a collection of social, psychological processes whereby public linguistic and other social, relational phenomena somehow are transformed into private cognitive and other psychological phenomena [e.g., Vygotsky, 1934/ 1986]. In similar broad strokes, agency typically is formulated as a kind of self-de- termination that is itself determined by sociocultural and biophysical structures and processes, yet is not entirely reducible to such non-psychological systems [e.g., Bruner, 1990]. In recent years, a number of developmentalists have proposed theo- ries of self-development that assume conceptions of internalization and agency that attempt to avoid overly strong forms of psychological constructivism on the one hand, and overly strong forms of social constructionism on the other [e.g., Bickhard, 2004; Harré, 1998, 2004; Tomasello, 1999]. These theoretical positions understand social interactivity and communication as developmentally indispensable to, and in many ways constitutive of, psychological personhood. Yet, they leave room for the exercise of rational and moral agency, whereby individuals can control (at least to some extent) and be held accountable for their actions. Such views are frequently associated with the theorizing of Vygotsky [1934/1986, 1978], sometimes with the work of Piaget [e.g., Carpendale & Lewis, 2004; Chapman, 1991, 1999], and occa- sionally with the body of ideas articulated by George Herbert Mead [1932/2002, 1934, 1938].\nIn developmental psychology, especially in more recent years, Mead’s interac- tionist view of the self-societal dialectic has been both endorsed as an early relation- al theory of the development of mind and consciousness through participation with others [e.g., Marková, 1987], and derided as a form of social determinism that dis- places genuinely moral and rational forms of human agency [e.g., Davidson & Youniss, 1995]. More recently, Mead’s work has received brief and passing mention in major volumes concerned with the social and cultural origins of human thought, mind, and selfhood [e.g., Hobson, 2002; Tomasello, 1999]. Such differential and ab- breviated treatment is understandable given the well-know diffi culties in interpret- ing Mead’s oeuvre. Much of it is derived from lectures and unpublished fragments that have been preserved and published through the note taking and editing of oth- ers. Mead also seems to have championed somewhat different views in different writings. It is thus not surprising that Mead scholars have offered several interpreta- tions of his work [e.g., Blumer, 1980; Cook, 1993; Gillespie, 2005; Joas, 1997; Wiley, 1995].\nHerein, Mead is interpreted as a perspectival realist who had a great deal to say that is highly relevant to contemporary debates and questions within developmental psychology concerning internalization and agency. In what follows, it will be main- tained that Mead’s theory of perspective taking offers a viable, alternative account of internalization that is both theoretically progressive and empirically suggestive.\nMoreover, this is an account that provides a plausible compatibilist interpretation of agency as both determined and determining, in the societal-personal, co-constitu- tive manner seemingly desired by many developmentalists [e.g., Bruner, 1990; Ro- goff, 1992; Valsiner, 1991].\nConsequently, what follows, while centrally concerned with perspective taking, is not in any way intended as a review of, or detailed commentary on, the vast lit- erature in developmental psychology that is concerned with perspective taking [for this, see recent reviews and commentaries by Chandler, 2001; Flavell, 1992; Menna & Cohen, 1997; Schober, 1998]. Rather, the central intention is to describe Mead’s theory of perspectivism and perspective taking in the context of his social, develop- mental psychology, and to consider some of its possible theoretical and empirical implications for conceptualizing and studying internalization and agency. Unlike most contemporary developmental psychologists, Mead does not treat perspective taking primarily as a signifi cant developmental accomplishment that marks our progress as epistemic agents. Instead, he considers perspective taking as a basic con- dition of our sociality and ontological constitution as agentive selves in interaction with others.\nMead’s Perspective Realism and Theory of Perspectives The term ‘perspective’ was not used by Mead until about 1920, when he began to articulate his mature philosophical position in opposition to traditional meta- physics. In the traditional view, for something to be objective or real, that thing can- not depend on any other thing, but must stand on its own. Mead was concerned that such an assumption relegated many important and infl uential social and psycho- logical entities and processes to the realm of the illusory and imaginary, and threat- ened to sweep social and developmental psychology toward the twin brinks of ideal- ism and solipsism. In developing his theory of the objective reality of perspectives [Mead, 1932/2002, pp. 153–170], Mead was at pains to put our sociocultural and psychological functioning back into the world in such a way that it might be the ob- ject of rigorous scientifi c study and consideration.\n‘In his later years, Mead often used “being in the perspective of the other” in- stead of “taking the role of the other”’ [Miller, 1982, p. 17]. Cook [1993] has noted that Mead came to use the phrases, ‘take the attitude of the other … taking the role of the other,’ and ‘take the perspective of the other … more or less interchangeably’ (pp. 79f). For Mead, our entire human sociocultural and psychological world is real, but perspectival (i.e., dependent on us). Mead defi ned perspectives as orientations within a larger context that arise through, and always remain related to, human con- duct in the world. ‘The perspective is the world in its relationship to the individual and the individual in his relationship to the world’ [Mead, 1938, p. 115]. ‘The world, things and the individual are what they are because of this relation’ [Mead, 1938, p. 215]. When entered into, perspectives are both perceptual and conceptual. Al- though they arise within particular sequences of social interactivity, they are not fi xed to a particular present. As a consequence, once they are experienced, they can be used imaginatively.\nThus, a perspective is an orientation to an environment that is associated with acting within that environment. Perspectives emerge out of activity and enable in- creasingly complex, differentiated, and abstracted forms of activity. Because the hu- man world is a social world, all perspectives arise and are employed within interper- sonal interactivity. Even though perspectives may be elaborated imaginatively and honed refl ectively, they are seeded and maintained through interactions with others.\nThis is not to say that there is no biophysical world that constrains and also enables human interactivity. It is simply to recognize that biophysical conditions, although necessary, are in no way suffi cient for perspectivity of the kind that enables the de- velopment and functioning of social-psychological phenomena like mind and self. It is important to emphasize that for Mead, the taking of perspectives is not primarily an epistemological matter through which we come to understand our world and our selves. Rather, it is an ontological matter. It is by taking perspectives that exist in the sociocultural world in which we are embedded from birth that we come to exist as self-interpreting beings at all.\nSocial acts are collective acts that involve two or more participating individuals, and social objects are collective objects with meanings that can be shared by par- ticipating individuals. Social objects are what they are by virtue of their embedded- ness within the matrix of social acts that makes up the life of a society. Bones of animals become weapons in the experience of early human individuals engaged in social acts of confl ict, and balloons become toys when bounced back and forth be- tween a mother and her child. At a more abstract level, minds and selves also arise out of human interactive activity, especially communicative activity supported by the signifi cant symbols of language. Mead [in Reck, 1964, pp. 134–141] maintains that communication in humans begins, both phylogenetically and ontogenetically, as a conversation of gestures that gradually becomes transformed into a conversation of signifi cant symbols (i.e., language). Signifi cant symbols ‘call out’ in the individual using them functionally similar responses to what they call out in others to whom they are directed.\nTaking the perspective of the other is essential to Mead’s conception of the sig- nifi cant symbol [Gillespie, 2005]. Most importantly for current purposes, signifi cant symbols are not to be understood only as shared, singular perspectives (i.e., as the evocation of the same meaning in different individuals, as in Morris’ introduction to Mead, 1934, p. xxi), but more importantly as simultaneously experienced, dual perspectives. ‘It is through the ability to be the other at the same time that he is him- self that the symbol becomes signifi cant’ [Mead, in Reck, 1964, p. 244]. For example, as I tell what I regard as an amusing anecdote to a friend, I watch his reactions for signs of enjoyment, simultaneously adjusting and embellishing my story, at least in part, on the basis of what I fi nd there.\nWith this in mind, consider Miller’s [1982] statement about the centrality of the signifi cant symbol to Mead’s thought.\nMead’s most profound insight consists in understanding that the signifi cant symbol, the language symbol, consists of a gesture whose meaning is had by both the one who makes the gesture and the other to whom it is addressed. He spent most of his intellectual life unravel- ing this insight. (pp. 10–11) However, as Gillespie [2005] has argued, based on Mead’s later perspectivism, the true importance of the signifi cant symbol with respect to the development of thought, consciousness, and selfhood concerns the simultaneous positioning of the individual within two or more perspectives. It is being in two perspectives at the same time, simultaneously taking multiple positions within meaningful sequences of conduct, that defi nes sociality for Mead. It is within this sociality that mind and self emerge.\nFor Mead, human conduct must be understood as an emergent unfolding of se- quences of social acts within which individuals react to both others and themselves.\nSuch a conception of social conduct makes it possible to understand Mead’s theory of how consciousness and selfhood arise through a graduated, social developmental process of intersubjectivity. It is within interactions with others that infants become other to themselves. They do this by taking the perspectives of others, and then by reacting to the self and other perspectives that emerge within their ongoing interac- tivity.\n‘Internalization’ and Agency within Sociality The self is something which has a development; it is not there, at birth, but arises in the process of social experience and activity, that is, develops in the given individual as a result of his relations to that process as a whole and to other individuals within that process.\n[Mead, 1934, p. 135] What distinguishes the forms of consciousness that can be experienced by the normal, adult human being from the more basic forms of sensitivity to the environ- ment likely experienced by other animals and infants is the refl exivity of the self.\nThis is a refl exivity that only can arise through interactions with others within an ongoing social process. Pre-refl ective consciousness refers to a world that is there, but refl ective consciousness or refl exivity refers to a world as experienced by a self that is capable of being both a subject and an object to itself. The individual becomes ‘an object to himself by taking the attitudes of other individuals toward himself within an organized setting of social relationships’ [Mead, 1934, p. 255].\nBy reinterpreting Mead’s social developmental psychology, as set forth in Mind, Self, and Society and several of his earlier essays, through his theory of perspectives within social conduct, it is possible to arrive at a detailed understanding of what is involved in achieving selfhood, self-understanding, and agency. Such an understand- ing highlights two features of Mead’s theory of perspective taking: (1) the importance of simultaneously being in one’s own and another’s perspective, and (2) the impor- tance of reacting to the multiple perspectives that one is in.\nBeing in Different Perspectives Simultaneously In Vygotsky’s [1978, p. 56] famous analysis of the child’s internalization of the meaning of pointing, he provides a feedback theory in which the mother responds to the child’s reaching by bringing an object closer to the child, thus converting the child’s grasping into pointing. Although feedback theorizing of this kind moves from a dyadic, child-object to a triadic, child-object-other model of explanation, it does not deal adequately or fully with the intersubjective, subject-subject relation [Gil- lespie, 2005]. In this example, the feedback theory does not endow the mother with a perspective that can be taken by the child, and occupied together with the child’s own initial perspective. Consequently, the feedback theory cannot explain adequate- ly how the child becomes other to himself.\nFor Mead, the child displays the meaning of pointing when she is able to re- spond appropriately to the situational pointing of her mother as well as to stimulate herself to act as her mother would act in response to her (the child’s) own pointing gestures. To understand how one might become other to oneself, Mead turned to social conduct, especially to the subject-subject relation, in a manner that brought the perspective of the other into the analysis. What he realized is that from the earli- est days of life, the developing self already is engaging with the perspective of the other in rudimentary social interactions. With this realization, the key question be- came one of understanding how the developing child could begin to experience the position or situation of the other (parent or caregiver) within social interaction. The answer for Mead lay in the young child’s repeated, and somewhat predictable se- quences of interaction with others in which she has exchanged roles and positions (e.g., sometimes passing a ball and sometimes receiving it; sometimes crying and sometimes comforting; sometimes asking and sometimes receiving; sometimes dis- puting and sometimes placating).\nVery early in development, such perspective taking is exceedingly rudimentary, amounting to little more than a pre-refl ective recollection and anticipation of p hases and positions within very simple gestural sequences (e.g., pushing a ball back and forth, with some assistance from a caregiver). However, through repeated social ex- perience of sequences of gestures, responses, and consequences, in interaction with their caretakers, infants gradually comprehend and anticipate the meanings of rou- tine social gestures. They simultaneously build up clearer recognitions of their care- givers and other objects in their micro social environments. Through repetitively shared sequences of interactive gestural activity, young children acquire a primitive sense of gestural meanings and come to distinguish particular social objects like mother and father. They then can begin to develop awareness of their own actions and selves through interactions that use signifi cant symbols, and eventually through more refl ective forms of interpersonal and societal perspective taking [Baldwin, 1986].\nAs Gillespie [2005] makes clear, for Mead the way to understand perspective taking was to stay focused on the social act: A social act refers to a social interaction that has become an institution, with established positions (i.e., buyer/seller, teacher/student, parent/child, boss/subordinate) that are stable over time. The introduction of both time and social structure is a breakthrough. Although the perspectives of self and other within any ongoing social act are necessarily divergent, if one takes into account time and a stable social structure, then it is possible that at some previous point in time, the positions of self and other were reversed. Given this, each par- ticipant in a social act may, by virtue of previous responses while in the position of the other, already possess the attitude of the other … It is because self and other are often in the same situations, or social positions, and acting toward the same objects, that the child comes to acquire the same attitudes that others have. (pp. 27–28) Over time, and in this manner, as the child’s social interactions widen and deepen, she eventually acquires the perspectives of others common to the social pro- cesses and communities in which she participates, thus taking the attitude of what Mead calls the generalized other or generalized others [Cronk, 1973]. This more ab- stracted process of perspective taking eventually can be continued vicariously and imaginatively through engagements with orientations and views available in diverse media including literature and fi lm.\nOnce the child has taken the perspectives of others in the way Gillespie [2005] has described, she only has to react to herself through these perspectives that she previously has engaged in interactions with others. As already hinted, the key here lies in exchanging and reversing roles within sequences of social interactivity, espe- cially in coming to occupy two or more positions or perspectives simultaneously.\nOne major way in which such multiple occupation of perspectives is developed is through play and games, which are characterized by positional exchange, both ac- tual and imaginary. Gillespie [2005] points out that games encourage the simultane- ous evocation of two or more perspectives by (1) providing opportunities for moving between complementary social positions (e.g., receiving and making a pass in a game of football), (2) providing rules that bridge perspectives housed in different positions and situations within the game (e.g., passing and receiving a football in ways that do not run afoul of the off-side rule), and (3) providing a context in which vocal gestures between players can serve to integrate perspectives in an immediately concrete man- ner (e.g., calling for a ‘pass’ and responding to that call). The important point is that it is through repeated and graduated participation in different positions within rou- tine, everyday social interactions (including play and games) that the child is able to take different perspectives, and eventually to occupy different perspectives simulta- neously. Such multiple perspectivity allows the child to be other to herself, so that she is able to react to those very perspectives that now constitute her as a social be- ing (i.e., as a ‘Me’).\nReacting to Perspectives The importance of reacting to the perspectives of others that one has previous- ly experienced in social interactions that have involved reversals of roles and posi- tions should not be underestimated. For Mead, the activity of the self is conditioned by, but not determined by the social situations and processes within which it emerg- es. Human agency is conditional but free. In order for the self to become an object to itself, it is not enough to take the perspectives of others as experienced in one’s past and current history of interactivity. In addition, it is necessary to react to the self that appears in current action and imagination as a consequence of such past engagement. Mead’s self thus has two dimensions or phases: (1) a ‘Me’ that consists in the perspectives of others based on past experience, and (2) an ‘I’ that reacts to the ‘Me’ and the current situation in terms of an imagined future in which the ‘Me’ is restructured. Mead’s distinction between the ‘Me’ and the ‘I’ brings both tempo- rality and sociality to bear on agency. The ‘Me’ is an objective self that contains per- spectives and possibilities for social interaction gleaned from a past history of social interactivity. The ‘I,’ especially in novel and problematic situations, reacts to the ‘Me’ in the immediate moment of action, and, in so doing, enters into a reconstruct- ed ‘Me’ of the next moment, while simultaneously preparing the ground for a newly emergent future ‘I.’ Mead’s conception of emergence [Mead, 1932/2002] is that of a disruption in experience – an impasse in the continuity of passage from the present to the future, which anticipates a more distant future in which harmony will be restored. As Saw- yer [2002, p. 9] recently has pointed out, sociality, or simultaneous positioning with- in different systems and perspectives, was, for Mead, an integral aspect of emer- gence. In particular, emergence is a consequence of occupying perspectives in ways that admit to heretofore unexperienced and unimagined possibilities. However, Mead, unlike many theorists of emergence in contemporary science and social sci- ence, insisted on a social level of reality with unique constitutive powers that was not reducible to biophysical levels of the world [also see Archer, 1995; Bhaskar, 1979; Martin, 2003].\nFor Mead, the immediate moment of action brings together a concern of the present with both recollections of relevant past activity and anticipations of a future in which the concern or problem to which the action of the present is directed is resolved or somehow made manageable. Such concerns typically are emergent in the fi eld of activity, within the ongoing dynamic interplay of social, interpersonal, and personal perspectives. They arise in the immediate context of novel, unpredict- able occurrences that constitute a change in past action sequences and perspectives.\nIf such emergent change were not common, our minds and selves would be deter- mined entirely by our past interactions in our biophysical and sociocultural world, and our worldly conduct would not be punctuated and experienced in temporal terms. It is precisely because of the emergence of change that our temporal experi- ence and agency also arise. Psychological time requires markers, and change sup- plies them.\nTo summarize, Mead’s theory of perspectives treats the taking of perspectives as embedded in, and emergent from, positional exchange and simultaneity within interpersonal interactivity. Mead’s perspective taking arises from participation within, and experience of, different positions and orientations within intersubjective communicative sequences and contexts. It is not a matter of somehow converting social processes to psychological ones, but of coming to participate in social interac- tivity as self-aware psychological persons. Mead never talked about having a perspec- tive on something. One is in a perspective and part of a perspective. A perspective is a relational, not a mental, entity. It is a relation of an individual or group to a situation, with respect to acting in that situation. To understand Mead’s approach to perspective taking, taking must not be given a mentalistic interpretation. More- over, the agency that is exercised by a self-aware psychological person is not deter- mined by biophysical and/or sociocultural factors, but is a reaction of a self-inter- preting being to those perspectives she is immersed in through her ongoing social interactions with herself, others, and the social, cultural communities in which she acts. In short, agency is a reaction to the situation in which one fi nds one’s self, and that situation always is a social situation. For Mead, both selfhood and agency arise developmentally through perspective taking (positional exchange, simultaneity, and coordination) within social acts.\nPerspectival Selfhood in Context Recall that a major rationale for Mead’s perspectival realism was to restore so- cial and psychological phenomena to the world, and to forestall a rush to subjectiv- ism, idealism, and solipsism. By treating social psychological perspectives as both real and emergent, he also hoped to resist reductive forms of social and psychologi- cal theorizing that he viewed as pseudo-scientifi c, in that they inappropriately re- duce, and thereby distort, exactly those entities (like mind, self, and consciousness) that need to be explained. Perspectives, in Mead’s sense, are always in the world.\nIndeed, they make up our social and cultural world. They have an objectivity that derives from the extent to which they are shared and function within our individual and collective experience [Mead, 1938].\nFor Mead, the reality and organization of perspectives is apparent in social con- duct within which the individual and others are immersed in a cooperative process of perspective taking. If a number of others are involved, the individual is able to take the perspectives of all of them, both as individuals and as a collective. She or he is able to do this by understanding what it is that they wish to accomplish – in other words, by comprehending the problematic situation they all confront, and in- ferring a sense of what would constitute a resolution for all concerned. At the begin- ning of interactions with others in problematic circumstances, such a common ele- ment in the perspectives of all participants might be framed as nothing more than the removal of the diffi culty that confronts them all. However, over time, and with accumulated interactions in the problem context through which different actions with respect to the problem are discussed and attempted, the individual is able to enter into the perspectives of others. At the same time, she enters into an emerging, more detailed common perspective as a consequence of her participation in this overall process of problem solving, a process which in turn is nested in the overall social process.\nWhat ultimately organizes these various perspectives is the extent to which they achieve collective support within the problem context and the social process in gen- eral. Since all perspectives are initially, at least to some extent, hypothetical, it is the development and application of perspectives within their contexts that organizes them. Perspectives that are unsuccessful in moving the group toward a resolution of the problem confronting them are discarded in favor of those that yield more suc- cess. Perspectives are organized in terms of their utility and viability across problem situations and distributed among those individuals interactive within them. Such organization and distribution result in a variety of generalized others, depending on the diversity of the social group and community in question. Mead’s generalized oth- ers may be thought of as organizations of perspectives that facilitate awareness of how various attitudes and roles are coordinated within complex social acts. Perspec- tives are social and objectively real in that they both constrain (acting consistently with generalized others in conventional situations) and enable (acting contrary to, or extending generalized others, especially in problem situations where convention- al perspectives fail).\nTo the extent that all emergent, hypothetical perspectives have the potential to become realized in social conduct, especially in problem situations, they are objec- tively in the real world that is the sum total of all perspectives. In Mead’s words, the emergent value which the individual organism confers upon the common world belongs to that world in so far as it leads to its creative reconstruction. In so far as the world is pass- ing into a future, there is an opportunity for that which is not objective to become objective.\n[Mead, 1938, p. 613] For Mead, the relation of an organism and an environment is continuously dy- namic. The natural and social world consists of a multiplicity of perspectives, any one of which may enter into an organism’s fi eld of activity. It is by virtue of the or- ganism’s ability to be several things simultaneously, in the sense of taking on (acting within) two or more different perspectives, that the organism is able to deal with emergent events or novel, unexpected occurrences. Because human persons are themselves social, their perspective taking may be enhanced greatly by communica- tion with others through signifi cant symbols.\nIt is precisely because human individuals are able to take the perspectives of others within the social process that they may acquire selves that are constituted by the perspectives available in their ongoing social encounters. Because social life is dynamically unfolding, the perspectival self is continuously emergent. Nonetheless, such a self is able to achieve suffi cient stability within the larger social process of organized, and potentially objective perspectives so that it can function with some success within the problem contexts that it necessarily will face in the course of liv- ing. As a ‘Me,’ the self consists of perspectival understandings and orientations. As an ‘I,’ the self is an active agent simultaneously occupying situations that have been in one sense determined by the past, but which (because of the ever-present emer- gence of novel circumstances) in another sense are open to determination by the momentary activity of the ‘I’ in the fl eeting present. By being simultaneously present in both of these temporal perspectives, the self is a source of both the achieved wis- dom of the past and the agentive cultivation of the future. Perspectives constitutive of selfhood must be coordinated suffi ciently with other social and interpersonal per- spectives to ensure functional levels of intelligibility and interactivity. However, such required coordination still leaves room for considerable creativity in achieving perspectival coordinations that might prove more functional and inclusive than con- ventionally extant organizations of perspectives [Martin, 2005].\nImplications for Contemporary Theory and Research Perspective Taking as ‘Internalization’ Mead’s theory of perspectives and perspective taking is a participation theory in which the functional meanings, self-other differentiations, and perspectival actuali- ties and possibilities resident in interactivity constitute our minds and selves. On this interpretation of Mead (even though he occasionally uses the term ‘internalization’ himself), there is no need to think of any of these developmental processes as requir- ing empathic or intentional theorizing that involves simulating how one would feel, think, and act in the situations of others, including their mental states. Of course, as developed adults, we are able to do all of these things, but according to Mead, we do not initially learn to do them through developing theories of minds. Such mental feats are products of more basic developmental processes. They are not primary develop- mental processes themselves. To posit them as basic mechanisms of internalization is to assume exactly what needs to be explained. Thus, unlike contemporary versions of theory of mind in developmental psychology [see Carpendale & Lewis, 2004 for a recent critical review], Mead understood interpreting the actions of others as an in- tersubjective process that privileges action with others over introspective thought.\nMoreover, processes like imitation and identifi cation, which many contemporary de- velopmental theorists [e.g., Hobson, 2002; Tomasello, 1999] understand as basic mechanisms of internalization, are treated by Mead as developmental consequences of the kind of participatory positioning and perspective taking he endorsed.\nPossible Theoretical Progress. M ead’s developmental account, as interpreted through his theory of perspectives, runs counter to much contemporary developmental psychology. In particular, it does not talk about the development of general or specifi c theories of mind [e.g., Gopnik & Wellman, 1992], esoteric forms of introspection that might be associated with imaginatively understanding one’s own or another’s inner functioning [e.g., Harris, 1992], or arrays of innate capabilities that make ‘mindfulness’ possible [e.g., Baron-Cohen, 1995]. In Mead’s approach, the mind and self are in the world as much as they are in individuals. It simply is a matter of perspective, and the taking of perspectives is fi rst and foremost a social activity.\nHowever, Mead’s account also departs in signifi cant ways from neo-Vygotskian accounts of internalization and from what may reasonably be regarded as neo- Meadian accounts by developmentalists like Marková [1987] and Hobson [2002].\nIn many ways, Mead’s perspectival theorizing, when applied to his social, develop- mental account, yields a participation alternative to internalization that demon- strates many of the theoretical advantages that Matusov [1998] previously has pre- sented in arguing for the participation theories of Lave and Wegner [1991] and Ro- goff [1990, 2003]. Not only does Mead’s theorizing seem helpful in overcoming dualisms inherent in internalization accounts, such as individual-social, inner-outer, and mind-action, it also provides a non-reductive account of the ongoing transfor- mation of social and cultural processes through the embedded, situated activity of real human agents. Moreover, it does so with at least somewhat greater precision than the more general descriptions provided by invoking vehicles of induction and transformation such as ‘legitimacy of participation’ and ‘communities of practice’ [Lave & Wenger, 1991, p. 117], as useful as such general terms may be as pointers to the important sociocultural practices to which they refer. Finally, Mead’s strong emphases on position exchange and simultaneity are not found in most neo-Vy- gotskian, participation theories.\nIt is perhaps easiest to evaluate critically Mead’s perspectival realism as a po- tential contribution to contemporary developmental theory by considering it in rela- tion to what may be the most thoroughly Meadian of all contemporary works, Hob- son’s [2002] The Cradle of Thought. The aim of Hobson’s work is to ‘begin with the mental life of babies and to end up with a story of how thinking … emerges in the course of early development’ (p. xiii). Hobson’s account assumes a central role for perspective taking, in that, ‘Thinking becomes possible because the child separates out one person’s perspective from another’s. More than this: thinking arises out of repeated experiences of moving from one psychological stance to another in relation to things and events’ (p. 105). According to Hobson, ‘the mechanism by which all this occurs is the process of identifi cation … To identify with someone is to assume the other person’s stance or characteristics’ (p. 105). To explain how the child be- comes aware of herself and others as beings who have and who can adopt perspec- tives, she fi rst has to take a perspective on herself and her own attitudes. It is only by doing this, by taking a view on her own ways of construing the world, that she can begin to think in terms of her own and others’ perspectives. This happens through a particular species of identifi cation: the child identifi es with others’ attitudes towards the child’s own attitudes and actions (p. 106).\nIn many ways, Hobson’s account is amazingly similar to the perspectival ren- dering of Mead’s developmental thought offered herein. Nonetheless, there are im- portant theoretical disjunctions that may be explored both theoretically and empir- ically in ways that might prove fruitful for contemporary developmental theorizing.\nTo make his thought more concretely accessible, Hobson [2002] employs a model consisting of a triangle of relations in which an infant relates to objects, persons, or events in the world; to herself as the other relates to her; and to the other’s relation to the world [also see Chapman, 1991, 1999]. One of the theoretical purposes to which Hobson puts his relatedness triangle is to explain how the infant becomes able to understand that there is not just one (i.e., her own) but two perspectives (e.g., her own and her mother’s) involved in her interactions with another concerning some aspect of the world (e.g., an object such as a toy). ‘What we need to explain is how the child comes to know that her movement into this position of the other amounts to her taking up a new perspective’ [Hobson, 2002, pp. 108–109]. Hobson’s answer, making use of his relatedness triangle, is to claim that through triangulation, a given object is experienced as in receipt of two different attitudes and meanings, and that ‘it is this that prompts the infant to separate out her own attitude from that of the other’ (p. 109).\nLike Mead, Hobson [2002] emphasizes the importance of simultaneously being in one’s own and another’s perspective in achieving an understanding of mind and self. Hobson also emphasizes the likely importance of taking cooperative, comple- mentary perspectives so that a rudimentary, pre-refl ective understanding of what is involved in sharing may serve as a stepping stone to experiencing connectedness with (when sharing is present), and separation from (when sharing is absent), some- one else [Hobson, 2002, p. 252]. However, where Hobson departs from the perspec- tival theorizing of Mead is by considering the perspective taking involved in the triangulation experiences he describes to be a kind of imitation made possible by a process of identifi cation. ‘There is something about our propensity to imitate others that is as basic as our intellectual prowess … It is the capacity to identify with oth- ers’ [Hobson, 2002, p. 215].\nJust as one person’s expressions of feeling can move someone else to feel things in sympathy, so a person may identify with someone else in the act of imitation. This, too, involves a kind of movement into the other person’s position. The person who imitates assumes something of the mental orientation of the other person. (pp. 221–222) And, just in case there is any doubt about Hobson’s intentions concerning the primacy of processes of imitation and identifi cation with respect to perspective tak- ing, ‘Identifying with people is what leads to perspective taking’ (p. 271).\nOn a Meadian account, Hobson’s [2002] invoking of imitation and identifi ca- tion is both unnecessary and ill-advised. One problem is that neither imitation nor identifi cation, in Hobson’s theorizing and research, are given referential grounds or criteria other than those that defi ne the perspective taking they are supposed to ex- plain. Indeed, there is much in Hobson’s prose to suggest that imitation and identi- fi cation are identical to, or developmental consequences of, perspective taking, rath- er than causal or constitutive antecedents. A second problem is that in positing imi- tation and identifi cation as foundational, Hobson comes dangerously close to re-introducing exactly those aspects of conventional theory of mind and simulation theory that he seems otherwise at pains to dispel with his Wittgensteinian-inspired participation theorizing – ‘in relating to people we get access to minds directly, not via a convoluted route of inferences, deductions and analogies. Minds are neither so hidden nor so abstract as they seem’ [Hobson, 2002, p. 251].\nIn fact, though, it is not a mentalistic theory of mind with which Hobson wish- es to align himself, but Vygotskian internalization, exactly what the presentation of Meadian perspective taking herein is intended to replace (because of its dualism and mystery). According to Hobson, when all is said and done, we should look to Vy- gotsky, for his theory of internalization ‘is a process that may explain what we need to explain: the newly appearing qualities of thinking and the new kinds of self and self-awareness. This is the process of interiorization described by Lev Vygotsky and central to psychoanalytic accounts of development. It is the process by which things that happen between people become things that happen within the individual’s own mind’ [Hobson, 2002, p. 257].\nFor Mead, mind is not an individual property. As stated earlier it is a relation- al entity distributed across and within those coordinated, intersubjective patterns of interaction with others that imbue our worldly actions with meaning. Moreover, there is no need to get behind perspectives. What are most basic are perspectives through which we engage and share in the social process in general, as well as in its particular manifestations in our life histories of interpersonal exchanges within which we emerge as self-conscious, self-interpreting beings. This is not to deny that we eventually come to be able to think in private, to theorize about other minds, or to chart and plan our lives. It is to say that all of these and our other mental and per- sonal activities and capabilities have their ontogenetic sources in social interactivity and participation, not in pre-existing or deeply interiorized mental capabilities and representations which afford us a detached view of the world. Although Hobson [2002] captures many of Mead’s insights concerning perspective taking and offers a potentially useful extension to Mead’s account by emphasizing the centrality of a social- emotional orientation to the development of mind, he seems at times to want to go beneath Mead’s developmental bedrock of social interactivity with others.\nThere can be little doubt that Mead would resist any such excavation.\nSuggested Empirical Research. If Mead’s perspectival social psychology is really to constitute a viable alternative to theories of internalization in contemporary developmental psychology, it should be possible to point to empirical implications and demonstrations and/or assessments of its central claims. First, however, it should be noted that the Meadian conception of perspectives (as action orientations in relation to a larger context or environment) is quite different from the ‘in the head’ conception of perspectives frequently traced to Piaget. Consequently, in addition to extant and possibly future empirical evidence, support for Mead’s perspectivist interpretation of self and mental development necessarily involves appeals to scientifi c criteria such as parsimony, simplicity, and elegance. On such grounds, the preceding critical analysis of Hobson’s [2002] work and ideas is suffi cient to demonstrate that the Meadian account articulated herein makes fewer assumptions and avoids the logical circularity that besets many competitor accounts of the development of mind and self. For example, biological accounts [e.g., the nativism of Meltzoff & Brooks, 2001; the modularity of Baron-Cohen, 1995, 1999; and the evolutionary-ecological approach of Butterworth, 2003] assume many innately seeded internal mechanisms and competencies that Mead does not. More cognitive theories [e.g., the primary and secondary intersubjectivity of Trevarthan, 1993; the intentional insight approach of Tomasello, 1999] are replete with many mentalistic assumptions concerning representation and cognitive architecture that seem to suppose very early refl ective and conceptual abilities that are highly arguable [cf. Carpendale & Lewis, 2004]. Even more socially sensitive theories [e.g., Hobson, 2002; Moore & Corkum, 1994] seem to posit meta-representational capacities [Penner, 1991] and/or very early forms of identifi cation and imitation that are contestable.\nBy comparison, Mead’s perspectival realism gives us a rather straightforward account of the psychological consequences of participation with others in routine gestural and communicative interactions sanctioned within particular sociocultural contexts. It is interactivity within these conventional social practices that enables developing infants and children to experience and occupy a variety of social and personal perspectives, and to use them in both action and imagination. Of course, it may be that Mead’s approach is insuffi ciently replete with distinctions and mecha- nisms required to provide a fully satisfying theory of the development of mind and selfhood. But Mead’s approach offers a comparatively lean account that contains relatively little in the way of contestable assumptions and logical diffi culties. It also fi ts the existing empirical record as well as its competitors. The Meadian approach suggests at least two kinds of research that have not, to date, been popular in the empirical arm of developmental psychology.\nBecause little is assumed in Mead’s theory that is entirely hidden (i.e., all of the developmental mechanisms and events he describes may be quite readily located in sequences of social interaction), intensive longitudinal videotaping of interactions between neonates and their caregivers over the fi rst two years of life would provide a marvelously rich source of data against which to check Mead’s assertions in com- parison with those of other socially oriented theorists like Hobson [2002], as well as more cognitively and/or biologically oriented theorists like Trevarthan [1993]. In particular, it would be important in such studies to construct a number of opera- tional pointers to key processes such as identifi cation, imitation, intersubjectivity, and perspective taking (especially multiple perspective taking, in terms of role rever- sals, combinations, and coordinations) that might be used to adjudicate amongst competing accounts of key developmental accomplishments and processes.\nFor example, indications of perspective taking in intersubjective interactional sequences could be indicated by role reversals in which a caregiver and year-old child occupy different perspectives in simple, repeated actions – a child holds out a piece of food to a mother who takes a bite and then offers the food to the child by moving it toward the child’s mouth while simultaneously pointing with her other hand to the child’s mouth. Completion of such a simple sequence of role reversal and intersub- jective perspective taking might be indicated by the child taking a bite of the food and then offering it once again to the mother. Children’s play with dolls and other toys also may be observed for instances of positional exchange and simultaneity. If such instances could be interpreted reasonably as re-enactments of previously expe- rienced exchanges with caregivers, they would support Mead’s theoretical position.\nIn general, if perspective taking is developmentally foundational in the manner pro- posed by Mead, the child’s occupation and simultaneous coordination of roles and phases in diverse social interactions ought to be affected by the ways in which care- givers coordinate the child’s perspective with their own. This being so, it would be especially interesting to note possible differences in the quantity and quality of chil- dren’s perspective taking that might be related to their interactions with those pri- mary caregivers with whom they are most active socially.\nOf course, to some extent, it remains a matter of interpretation as to whether to treat particular aspects of events like food sharing or doll play as instances of par- ticipatory role and perspective taking or identifi cation and imitation. However, it also might be possible to train caregivers (or research assistants acting as caregivers) to take advantage of naturally occurring events of this kind, and follow them with quasi-scripted actions that are less immediately interactive in order to determine what responses, if any, the child might make to them. For example, following the food-sharing scenario just described, the caregiver or research assistant might move away from the child and begin engaging in a novel form of activity without looking at the child, or otherwise directing her movements to the child. If children consis- tently imitate the actions of others under these less interactive conditions, Mead’s thesis concerning the necessity of relational interactivity for perspective taking would be unsupported empirically. Obviously, a great deal remains to be worked out in any such potential program of research. However, it is clear that such work would need to be conceived in considerable theoretical detail, would be methodologically very challenging, and would demand a great commitment of time and energy from both participating families and researchers.\nA second kind of research that might be especially instructive with respect to examining empirically some of Mead’s central theoretical propositions could in- volve experimental or quasi-experimental interventions with young children in day- care centers. Mead has been interpreted [both herein and by Gillespie, 2005] as maintaining that cooperative interactions may be especially powerful bases for the development and taking of complementary perspectives, which very likely are the fi rst kinds of perspectives to be held simultaneously. This being so, structured ac- tivities involving role-play or games within which young children (both immediate- ly prior to and following the beginnings of language use) might be encouraged and helped to experience complementary phases or roles in structured communicative, action sequences could be arranged. The consequences of such interactivity then might be examined on subsequent tasks in which participating children are asked to demonstrate their perspective taking capability and self-understanding. By compar- ing such demonstrations to those of similar children who have not participated in the ‘complementary perspective’ interventions, it might be possible to gauge some- thing of the likely effects of such experiences.\nOf course, any such interventions would need to be of a reasonably lengthy du- ration, and the studies themselves would benefi t greatly from intensive, longitudinal recording and analysis of a carefully planned set of gradually more demanding and sophisticated forms of perspective sharing and multiple perspective taking over the course of the interventions. It might also prove instructive in such studies to contrast Meadian and Vygotskian forms of facilitative intervention. In the former, young children might be encouraged to participate in and reverse their participation across complementary roles within different phases of interactivity. In the latter, young children might be encouraged to expand and increase their perspective taking capa- bilities by building on the instructional scaffolding provided by more developmen- tally advanced others (perhaps including modeling that emphasizes identifi cation with, and imitation of, researcher-teachers and/or older children).\nThe simultaneous occupation and reactive consideration of non-complemen- tary, even antagonistic, perspectives may be viewed as demanding greater accumu- lated experience of perspective taking and multiple perspectival involvement. It is an empirical question as to whether these more oppositional forms of perspective taking really can develop out of initially complementary perspective taking as Mead suggests. Certainly there are several extant theoretical perspectives [e.g., Bakhtin, 1986; Billig, 1987; Hermans, 2002; Wertsch, 1991] that might contest such a devel- opmental sequence as too facile.\nPerspective Taking and Agency It is by means of perspectives, which are experientially occupied and available actually and imaginatively as situated resources for action, that individuals become Meadian ‘Mes.’ However, agency goes beyond the ‘Me’ in that it manifests as a reac- tion to the ‘Me,’ one which may become increasingly self-interpretive with repeated and differentiated experiences, especially in problem-solving situations. Of course, this Meadian ‘I’ need not be self-consciously or even consciously engaged. In many ways, Mead seems to suggest that a basic pre-refl ective, reactive agency is part of what it is to be a human being participating in social processes with other human beings. In this sense, one is an agent by acting and reacting to extant perspectives available in social situations. However, there is little doubt that Mead also is com- mitted to a rather strong program of self-refl ective rational and moral agency, espe- cially during adulthood: There are no absolute values. There are only values which, on account of incomplete social organization, we cannot as yet estimate, and in face of these the fi rst enterprise should be to complete the organization if only in thought so that some rough sort of estimate in terms of the other values involved becomes conceivable. [Mead in Reck, 1964, p. 262] As a functional reaction to perspectives and situations, our agency is constantly emergent within those concerns and problems that we encounter in our sociocul- tural and biophysical world. Mead understood agency as a situated reaction to extant perspectives that goes beyond them in the act of reacting to them. His account of agency thus resists the classic dualism of free will versus determinism.\nPossible Theoretical Progress At least a few contemporary developmental theorists have formulated theories of emergent agency that may be related to aspects of Mead’s thought. For example, Bidell and Fischer [1997] have presented an epigenetic account that treats our ge- netic make-up and sociocultural context and participation as active self-organizing systems that, together with persons as self-organizing systems, jointly determine our intellectual and agentic development. However, unlike Mead, Bidell and Fischer understand the human agent not as multiply situated, reactive, and functionally ori- ented to the future resolution of problems, but as actively creative in the construc- tion, within a process of hierarchical integration, of new concepts and skills. Despite their declarations of systems-wide epigenesis, Bidell and Fischer, like many contem- porary developmentalists, adopt a highly cognitive, representational, and operation- al framework that locks the developing agent inside her own cerebral mechanisms in interaction with her environment and genetic make-up, rather than viewing her as creatively participating in social processes and interpersonal interactions in ways that transform both her society and her self.\nA more Meadian outlook may be found in the work of Mark Bickhard [1999, 2004]. To Bickhard [2004], ‘An infant is a socially tuned biological creature with marvelous capacity for development into a participant in, and co-creator of, social realities’ (p. 125). For Bickhard, social realities take the form of situational and in- stitutional conventions. Some of these conventions hold across multiple times and people. Some must constantly be worked out in an ongoing process of interpersonal interactivity. Conventionalization consists in large part of common understandings and practices that contain distinctive roles and functions. Participation in social conventions constitutes the world of the individual in a deeply normative sense.\nNormativities themselves ‘are emergent from, ontologically involved in, and func- tion as constraints – and enabling constraints – upon individual level values and actions’ (p. 119). For Bickhard [2004], ontogenetic development is the story of the emergence of an entirely new kind of being, one who participates in society and culture and history. And the person, in so participating, participates in the emergent creation of society in turn … The person is constituted in the multiple ways of being social that that individual has de- veloped in that society and culture and historical time. (pp 125–126) Bickhard’s work follows the general pragmatist approach taken by Mead [1934], especially with respect to emphasizing the naturalness of the functional relations he assumes between persons and their environments. ‘Interactive representation … emerges with complete naturalism out of certain sorts of functional organizations’ [Bickhard, 1999, p. 450]. Note that this is not the kind of cognitive representation thought to consist of encodings of external objects and events. What is represented is not objects, things, or entities in the world, but possibilities for acting. Such ‘func- tions’ are always emerging, and differentiate the environment in ways that open up interactive possibilities. With respect to persons and their societies, Bickhard under- stands both as constantly emergent and co-constitutive. The sociocultural environ- ment is constitutive of personhood in two senses: constructive and interactive. Constructively, learning to engage in the simpler social interactions of childhood provides the scaffolded resources for the eventual construc- tion of the adult social person. Interactively, the person is being social insofar as he or she is interacting with or within those social realities. … Personhood, in being a socially con- stituted constructive emergent, is itself a social and historical ontology. [Bickhard, 1992, p. 86] For Bickhard, the person is a socially spawned agent capable of contributing to her participation in those interactions and social processes in which she exists. Her previous social experiences have provided her with a set of functions she can use to think and act in relation to current and future contexts. This is a very Meadian un- derstanding of agency, yet one which still does not make full use of the theoretical resources that Mead’s perspectivism has to offer.\nTo date, no contemporary developmental psychologist, or any other contempo- rary psychologist for that matter, has theorized agency in a manner specifi cally con- sistent with Mead’s perspectivism – as a constantly emergent reactivity to those multiple perspectives within which the socially involved and constituted person is situated and active. As already noted, in early development, such an agency is most- ly pre-conceptual and non-deliberatively reactive. However, with greater experience in conventional social processes and interactions, the developing human agent is increasingly able to take and work within a multiplicity of perspectives. Such multi- perspectival experience enables a much more refl ective, deliberative agency that may be targeted at specifi c problems and concerns [Martin, Sugarman, & Thompson, 2003].\nSuggested Empirical Research To indicate ways in which a more truly Meadian conception of agency might be infused into research in developmental psychology, it is possible to extend the two lines of research suggested and developed earlier when considering research on ‘in- ternalization.’ For example, the kind of naturalistic, longitudinal study outlined above might explore opportunities for children to apply their nascent ability to oc- cupy two complimentary perspectives to novel situations. For instance, a third indi- vidual (another research assistant) might enter the room and point at what remains of the food that had been offered and received by mother and child in the earlier example, and then point to her own mouth. The ability of young children with dif- fering experiences of complimentary perspectival exchange and coordination to re- spond agentically in such relatively unfamiliar interpersonal contexts would speak directly to the developmental links between perspective taking and personal agency posited by Mead. With older children who have some use of language and greater familiarity with simple picture books, toy models, and audiovisual media, more ad- vanced forms of perspective taking might be examined. To this end, researchers might consider assisting caregivers and research assistants to sprinkle their ongoing interactions with their young charges with a diverse range of perspective taking ac- tivities. Useful ideas for such activities are readily available in the various scenarios that frequently have been used by developmental psychologists who have studied role and perspective taking over the years [e.g., Light, 1979]. Of course, a careful, longitudinal recording of instances of perspectival exchange, coordination, and ap- plication to novel circumstances would speak directly to Mead’s perspectival theo- rizing with or without such planned, quasi-scripted extensions to ongoing, naturally occurring interactions between adults and children. Nonetheless, the deployment of such extensions would certainly increase the amount and variety of interaction di- rectly relevant to perspective taking in Mead’s terms.\nThe second kind of research suggested earlier consisted of experimental or quasi-experimental interventions in which cooperative interactions that encour- aged the simultaneous occupation of complementary perspectives were facilitated in an attempt to expedite the perspective taking and self-understanding of young children. Such studies also could examine relationships between participation in interventions that encourage the occupation of multiple perspectives and the agen- tic reactivity of children to these perspectives. Once again, creative variations on a variety of extant role- and perspective-taking tasks and demonstrations might be employed to examine direct and vicarious indications of agentic capability that, ac- cording to Mead, might be expected to emerge from experiences of multiple per- spectivity. Actions potentially indicative of agency might be theorized and coded within situations and tasks that are purposefully constructed to contain novel and/ or problem elements not found in the contexts and tasks employed in the interven- tions per se. Many childhood games (e.g., hide-and-seek, I spy, and clue) are condu- cive to perspectival exchange, simultaneity, and coordination, and can be tailored by researchers to enhance further the various kinds of persepctivity encouraged and to introduce novel elements into routine sequences of game activity. Diffi cult con- ceptual and theoretical issues concerning what constitutes suffi cient similarity and difference to warrant ascriptions of agency to children’s interactive and situational actions would obviously pose signifi cant challenges in such research. However, there is no reason to suspect that these would, at least in principle, prove any more diffi cult than the host of conceptual, defi nitional, and theoretical matters that at- tend extant research on perspective taking [see Chandler, 2001; Menna & Cohen, 1997; Schober, 1998].\nConclusion In an autobiographical refl ection on his then 35 years as a developmental psy- chologist studying perspective taking, John Flavell [1992], whose neo-Piagetian ac- count stands as one of the major theoretical positions in this area of theory and re- search, states that: My coworkers and I get the impression when testing young 3-year-olds that most of them are simply not ‘maturationally ready’ to understand our questions about mental representa- tions, and that the best we can do is just wait for them to grow a little older. … There is just not enough there yet on which to build. (p. 133) But, if, as Flavell goes on to say, ‘young children do not know that they and other people have conceptual, perceptual, and affective perspectives … [and] they do not know that people mentally represent the world’ (pp. 133–134), why do so many developmental psychologists insist on describing perspective taking in terms of simulation theories and theories of mind? Such theories assume that young infants understand other persons as animate agents, and so share emotions and en- gage with them dyadically; 9-months-olds understand other persons as goal-directed agents and so share goals (and perception) and engage them triadically; and 14-month-olds under- stand other persons as intentional agents and so share intentions (and attention) and engage with them collaboratively (so creating, via internalization, dialogic cognitive representa- tions). [Tomasello, Carpenter, Call, Behne, & Moll, in press] What Mead’s perspectivism, as applied to his social, developmental account of children’s perspective taking, reveals is that a viable theoretical option is to treat activity with others as a source of orientations toward action within routine situa- tions (i.e., as perspectives) that may be shared and occupied in pre-refl ective ways, thus creating important developmental bases for mind, self, and later forms of un- derstanding that are more clearly representational. For Mead, theories of develop- ment that assume that infants and very young children identify with, and imitate, others as consciously self-refl ective agents with unique mental perspectives and rep- resentations assume exactly what developmental theories should set out to explain.\nOur obviously important abilities to act refl ectively, intentionally, and self-con- sciously grow out of our activity with others and the early forms of perspective taking that such interactivity enables. They should not be invoked to make sense of the early intersubjectivity on which they depend. Mead consistently gave developmental primacy to social interactivity as a basis for higher forms of consciousness and cog- nition.\nIt is, of course, true that Mead’s defi nitions and conceptions of early perspective taking do not distinguish between perceptual and conceptual perspective taking [Chandler, 2001] or among a speaker’s situation and identity, conceptualizations, conversational agenda, and knowledge [Schober, 1998]. Without in any way denying that such distinctions may be both important and necessary for particular theoreti- cal and practical purposes, it nonetheless remains doubtful that they are needed to make plausible sense of perspective taking in early childhood. For Mead, perspective taking is a basic fact of sociality, which he understands as being in two or more per- spectives simultaneously. This form of perspective taking is not predominately men- talistic. It is relational and positional. It constitutes the very social reality in which we are embedded from birth, and through our ontogenetic experience it comes to constitute us as socially formed agents whose multiperspectival reactivity is a defi n- ing feature of the human condition and the ongoing self-societal dialectic. In many ways, more interactionist and participatory theories of early childhood development such as those of Bickhard [1999, 2004], Hobson [2002], and Rogoff [2003] begin to approach at least some of the Meadian ideas articulated herein, especially with re- spect to social, interpersonal processes related to ‘internalization’ and agency. How- ever, even here, the constitutive processes most central to Mead’s theorizing, multi- perspectival occupation and reactivity, have not to date received the attention they deserve.\nPerhaps, contemporary developmentalists have been overly infl uenced by the somewhat dismissive reception that Mead has been accorded by leading scholars like John Flavell. Flavell praises Mead for making ‘it diffi cult for all subsequent theorists, both to ignore the importance of communication processes in human development, and to ignore the importance of role taking in communicative processes’ [Flavell, Botkin, Fry, Wright, & Jarvis, 1968, pp. 15–16]. However, he goes on to criticize Mead for an alleged inability to explain the fi ner details of perspective taking – ‘he does not [explain] how A acquires the ability to discern B’s qualities as a responder generally, and in particular how he acquires the ability to select those gestures which will, in fact, arouse the same response in B’ [Flavell et al., 1968, pp. 15–16]. Hope- fully, one consequence of the interpretation of Mead’s theory of perspective taking offered herein (especially the joint processes of being within different perspectives simultaneously and responding agentively to them) will be to challenge such assess- ments of Mead’s actual and potential contribution to developmental thought, theo- ry, and research. Of course, any such reassessment of Mead’s contribution must await further theoretical and empirical inquiry into his detailed hypotheses concern- ing the social development of mind and self. At this writing, it is by no means clear that Mead’s theory of perspective taking is suffi cient as a developmental account of our ascendance to self-conscious experience during ontogenesis, or that it is capable of dealing with the challenges posed by perspectives that may be much more dra- matically oppositional than those available in the vast majority of his discussions and examples. However, it quite obviously is a more developed, specifi c, and de- tailed account than that assumed in much of the developmental literature that has referred to Mead’s ideas [e.g. Davidson & Youniss, 1995; Flavell et al., 1968].\nTo date, only a very few studies exist that have investigated Mead’s views em- pirically and theoretically in comparison with those of infl uential developmental theorists like Piaget and Vygotsky. One of these was concerned with the relationship between private speech and a child’s awareness of the meanings of actions [Kohl- berg, Yaeger, & Hjertholm, 1968]. Another [Light, 1979] dealt specifi cally with role taking in a manner that lends itself readily to Mead’s theorizing about perspectives and perspective taking as developed herein. The authors of both of these studies speculated that Piaget’s conception of egocentrism could potentially be tied to Mead’s emphasis on perspective taking in a highly complementary manner. Light [1979], in particular, suggests that where Piaget equated the problem of centering on a particular social perspective with that of cen- tering on a particular aspect of a situation … Mead [makes] the same equation, and [argues] that social decentration is a necessary condition for intellectual decentration. (p. 12) However, for Mead, perspective taking serves both epistemological and onto- logical functions during ontogenesis. It is not only our knowing, but more fundamen- tally our being or existence as psychological selves and agents that is at stake. It is only by occupying and reacting to perspectives available in the social reality in which we are active that we become psychological beings for whom understanding is a con- cern.",

    "text": "Abstract:\nThe pragmatism of George Herbert Mead has been fundamental to the sociological understanding of the self. However, the complexity of his work is largely unrecognized in the discipline. This mainly affects the way Mead intertwined discursivity with the materiality of experience in his conception of human subjectivity. Through a metatheoretical analysis, the present paper proposes a straightforward approximation between Mead’s theories of the self and the act in order to contemplate the incidence of processes encompassed by the latter upon the former. Based on this movement, and after a dialogue with Francis Chateauraynaud’s pragmatic sociology, the paper suggests a new Meadian-inspired sociological alternative to the concept of self, attentive to its material dimension and centered on the concepts of outer and inner grasps. The current discussion about the ontological politics in the context of a new mastery of nature allows for an empirical exercise of the argument.\nKeywords: George Herbert Mead; materiality; self; pragmatic sociology; risk\nIntroduction The prominence enjoyed by the idea of interaction in the theoretical framework of sociology is much indebted to George Herbert Mead’s pragmatist philosophy. His proposal of a socially developed individual self (Mead, 1903, 1910, 1912, 1913, 1922, 1925, 1967 [1934], 2011 [n.d.]) has been taken by different approaches within the sociological discipline as an axis for the solution of the polarization between structure and agency. The communicative properties of interaction, which stand out in his discussions on social psychology, have been pivotal in this aspect. However, sociology has underexplored the fact that neither interaction nor the self are restricted to such properties in Mead’s work.\nAlthough not focused directly or systematically on the topic of the self, his theory of the act and his general discussion on the human perception of physical objects (Mead, 1912, 1926, 1932, 2011 [n.d.], especially 1972 [1938]), suggest that the material dimension of experience is elementary for the self’s constitution and performance. The overall goal of the present article is of metatheoretical nature, namely, to develop a Meadian-inspired sociological alternative to the concept of self which is not limited to its internal and external symbolic transactions, but which is also attentive to the material groundings of such interactions.\nThe first section of the text sets the problem of the sociological undervaluation of Mead’s concern with the material properties of the self. I analyze the form in which three specific authors, Herbert Blumer, Jürgen Habermas and Axel Honneth were central for the reduction of Mead’s complexity to his proposition of symbolically mediated intersubjectivity as the pillar of the dynamics of socialization. A fourth scholar, Hans Joas, partially departs from the problem, but still joins the others in a limiting view on the internal composition of the self which, due to the wide reach of their readings of Mead, became hegemonic in the social sciences. A counter-hegemonic understanding of the inner structure of the self is addressed in the following section, which presents an internal reconstruction of Mead that straightforwardly brings together his theories of the self and the act. It addresses the issue of materiality in the Meadian act based on Markell’s reading of the concepts of “I” and “me” (Markell, 2007) and puts into dialogue three different faces of Mead, which are not systematized in his own work due to its fragmented characteristic: the Jamesian, Deweyan and Whiteheadian ones. The purpose behind this move is to seek in Mead’s own conceptual edifice the foundation for a conception of the self where the materiality of experience plays active role in the construction of subjectivity.\nThe third and last section sets off seeking to empirically ground the previous conceptual work. The social sciences have recently faced epistemological challenges set by technological advancements in ventures such as biotechnology and geoengineering, which promote what Pellizzoni (2015) has named the new mastery of nature. Based on new forms of structural intervention in matter, these new technologies increasingly guide considerations about the relations between nature, capitalism and risk towards an ontological dimension of analysis. They also set the stage for renewed reflections on the intersection between the material contact with the world and the production of subjectivity within contemporary modernity. Accordingly, I draw upon the aforementioned metatheoretical endeavor in order to tackle the vicissitudes of this new historical formation. My starting point for this task lies in considering that Mead’s pragmatism is as important to detail the engine moving the political ontology of this new relationship with nature as it is to build an inquiry critique based on practical consequences as the most adequate criterion for judgement. In a decisive point of this last section I signal the need for a sociological interlocutor able to back up Mead’s material concerns, suggesting Francis Chateauraynaud’s pragmatic sociology, and specifically his discussion around the concept of grasps (prises), as fit for this purpose. I then settle my argument with a Meadian rendering of Chateauraynaud, advancing the idea of the individual self as composed by inner and outer grasps. By taking such a step, on the one hand, the operationalization of elements such as conflict, asymmetry and domination in Mead is enabled, whereas, on the other hand, Chateauraynaud’s sociology benefits from a valuable input for the construction of a pragmatics of interiority.\n\nThe neglect of Mead’s ecological view of the self in social theory and the hegemonic interpretation of the “I” and the “me” Not a sociologist himself, Mead’s incorporation into the discipline often relied on the mediation of authors directly affiliated to sociology or with a wide margin of influence over its academic field. Throughout the 20th century, symbolic interactionism and critical theory provided decisive entry points for the “sociologization” of Mead, imprinting their marks on the form which sociologists absorbed his concepts (Silva, 2007; Huebner, 2014).\n\nIn this section I draw a critical appraisal of four interpretations of Mead made by different authors: Herbert Blumer (symbolic interactionism), Jürgen Habermas and Axel Honneth (critical theory) and Hans Joas (linked to both critical theory and Chicago’s sociological tradition). Notwithstanding notable differences among them, the first three authors converge on what can be deemed as a problematic understanding of Mead’s conception of self, which has as one of its outcomes the omission of the importance of materiality in his pragmatism.\nJoas, on the other hand, hints at the direction for the solution of this problem, but does not follow the path to the end, since he stands by the same limiting understanding of the Meadian concepts of “I” and “me” as that of the other three authors.\nIt is worth discussing briefly some of the most substantial elements of Mead’s thought about the social construction of the self and its communicative properties in order to understand the role the aforementioned authors reserve for him in their own respective works. By assuming an anti-Cartesian position, Mead does not consider the self as an anthropological starting point but conceives it as the outcome of ecologically contextualized communicative processes that evolve both phylogenetically and ontogenetically. Two influences are central to him in this assertion: the integrating view that, by late 19th century, Dewey (1896) launched over the concepts of stimulus and response in perception and the relevance proposed by Wundt of the interchange of gestures as a foundational factor of language (Mead, 1903, 1910, 1922)1. Mead locates the origins of the self in the conversation of gestures among two or more individuals belonging to a given species in the animal world.\nSuch conversation sets stimuli and response circuits that coordinate the succession of acts in the behavior of those individuals. The distinctive feature of the conversation of gestures in human species lies on its qualitative remark supported by the development of a reflective intelligence, or reflective conscience, capable of giving meaning to the expression of attitudes through significant symbols (Mead, 1910: 178, 1922: 161, 1967 [1934]: 45ff, 90- 100). A gesture brings along a significant symbol “[…] when it has the same effect on the individual making it that it has on the individual to whom it is addressed, or who explicitly responds to it […]” (Mead, 1967 [1934]: 46), whereas the origins of meaning lie on concrete interactions throughout the course of communicative experiences among individuals, when they mutually alter their responses by taking a specific goal as reference and reach a substantial degree of symbolic unity (Mead, 1967 [1934]: pp.77-80).\nOne of the most relevant consequences Mead extracts from his idea of reflective intelligence is that a gesture imprinted by an individual towards a companion of action, in other words, a stimulus to the other’s response, already carries along the projective anticipation of such a response, so that the uttering individual is also stimulated by its own gesture. The extension of this dynamics opens room for the continuous process of reciprocal 1 In regard to Mead’s intellectual relations with Dewey, it is correct to say they both influenced each other throughout their careers.\nmodification of gestures that structures the collective coordination of behaviors. By acting this way, the individual continuously relies upon the attitudes that others address towards it in order to become an object for oneself. In its turn, this subjective movement implies that the individual also acts as the very subject of oneself by rebuilding its position within the social act in a manner attuned to information provided by the world around to it (Mead, 1913: 379-380, 1922: 160, 1925: 267, 1967 [1934]: 135ff). We can observe, at this point, the socialized nature of the self. It is constituted as a psychosocial structure with interactive characteristics that expresses itself as an inner conversation, or forum, where both its subjective and objective aspects take part in. It encompasses reminiscences acquired by the individual actor through the environments it has experienced and the people it has lived and communicated with, directly or indirectly, throughout its life. These elements work out as raw material for the construction of this actor’s own individuality.\nMead’s social-psychological outline sketched above was taken by Blumer as the main pillar of his symbolic interactionist approach. Blumer (1969) relies on Mead’s discussion of the relation between mind, reflective intelligence and the significant symbol in order to suggest that society might be seen as comprised by the interlinkage of symbolic and non-symbolic interactions among individuals, and that sociology’s main task is to develop its analytical work specifically focused on the former. This is so because, in his view, Mead’s major legacy to sociology would be to portray society as constructed characteristically out of the conscious organization of meanings found in the intersubjective relations of a plurality of selves. For Blumer (1969: 23ff), therefore, “the obdurate character of the empirical world” that repeatedly challenges the rigid models of the sociologist is marked by the contingency and fluidity of the interchange of meanings that forms the core of people’s social experiences.\nSymbolic interactionism turned out to be a richly diversified sociological current, unrestricted to Blumer’s own ideas and with different degrees of proximity to Mead’s philosophy depending on each author (Joas, 1993: ch.1). However, it is notorious that over the years Blumer acted not as an ordinary epigone, but as heir apparent and legitimate interpreter of Mead, adapting his philosophical work to the language and empirical methodology of sociology. His particular approach was key for the reception of Meadian concepts in the American social sciences (Huebner, 2014: 158ff).\nAlthough critical theory’s first generation was quite skeptical about the validity of American pragmatism (Joas, 1993: ch.4), Mead’s social psychology was of great importance to the theoretical synthesis developed by Habermas, one of the leading figures of Frankfurt School’s second generation. Habermas found in Mead’s theoretical framework elements he believed were capable of restituting the emancipatory potential of the concept of reason within the universe of the German critique, since the pragmatist’s decentralized conception of conscience allowed him to wander about a consensual social dynamics based on cognitively and normatively justified actions. The Meadian concept of the generalized other was essential for Habermas to locate the construction of legitimacy within the communicative practices of the phenomenological concept of the lifeworld. In Mead’s work (1922: 161ff, 1925: 268ff, 1932: 87, 1967 [1934]: 154), the generalized other refers to the internalization of the structural organization of the attitudes of community by the individual.\nAkin to Blumer, but with structural inclinations, Habermas (1987 [1985]: 37-44) sees in this set of roles and expectations the key point of the production of norms, notwithstanding his conclusion that Mead, in his own work, shied away from a satisfactory solution to the problem of institutions.\nMead’s ideas are also an important reference for the architecture of Axel Honneth’s theory of recognition, which sought a new reformulation of Frankfurt’s critical tradition by introducing social conflict as the driving force of historical transformation. Honneth saw in the struggle for recognition the collectivized instance of the inner tensions of Mead’s self, the ones deriving from conversations or discussions between its two phases. In a very general way (to be further worked out shortly) we may define the“I” as the element which corresponds to the self’s subjective facet and the “me” as the one which is correlated to its objective facet (Mead, 1912, 1913, 1925, 1967 [1934], 2011 [n.d.]). According to Honneth’s reasoning (Honneth, 2002: 502), by taking the reciprocity of recognition “[…] as the individual evolution of a ‘me’ that consists in the consciousness of legitimate social expectations, then the ‘I’ could perhaps be conceptualized as the source of continuous rebellion against established forms of recognition […]”. By resorting to Mead, Honneth (1995 [1992]: 84-85) saw an opportunity to fill the motivational gap in Hegel’s theory of recognition. The “I” would be a force behind demands for the extension of society’s structures of recognition in favor of causes hitherto not incorporated by them, since it would be a source of irradiation of individuals’ creativity that stands up to the conventionality of the “me”.\nWhat has been discussed so far allows the realization that the form through which Blumer, Habermas and Honneth imported Mead’s thought does not make justice to it, since they access his discussion on the self from only one of the angles available in his work, namely: a social psychology concerned with the symbolic properties of the formation of consciousness and communication. Hans Joas, another student of Habermas trained in the Frankfurtian lineage, but who also established strong bonds to the Chicago tradition, shined light on some consequences of this limited view of Mead’s thought. According to Joas (1993: 137), Habermas’ restriction (also observed in Blumer and Honneth) of the Meadian conception of social interaction at gestural language level is a “misunderstanding” that would, furthermore, explain the assessment that a satisfactory discussion about the institutionalized social order is absent in Mead. Not only would that be untrue (given Mead’s concerns about democracy and science - Joas, 1993: 137, also see 1985 [1980]: ch.9; Silva, 2008), but the same interpretation puts aside other extremely important objects of Mead’s philosophy.\nAs suggested by Joas (1985 [1980]: 145ff), there was never a border in Mead’s writings between a world of action exclusively inhabited by humans and a world of non- human beings and inanimate objects fully excluded from linguistic exchanges. For the pragmatist philosopher, subjectivity and the production of meaning take place in complex milieus where human behavior is engaged with entities of plural constitutions. This feature evidences Mead’s connection to the strong naturalist profile spread over the pragmatist environment of Chicago during the passage from the 19th to the 20th century (Dewey et al, 1945; Cefaï, 2001). Reflecting on the ethical implications of this environmental characteristic of Mead, Brewster and Puddephatt (2016: 155) claim that his would be an “ecological view of the self”, which becomes “[…] more expansive both by being progressively more inclusive of diverse others [i.e. human and non-human] into our existing groups and communities and by progressively identifying with larger groups and communities […]”.\nBy stripping Brewster and Puddephatt’s proposition of its moral aspect (however relevant this is) we observe that an ecological view of the self also holds ontological and cognitive grounds in Mead’s thought. We may return to Joas (1985 [1980]: 159-161) for a relevant entry point to this argument when he recalls that, in Mead’s theory of the act (1932: 119-139, 1972 [1938], 2011 [n.d.]) the construction of the physical object by a perceptive subject is socially mediated and linked to the apprehension of the unity of the subject’s own body as the likely object of its action. However, Joas (1996: 181-184) does not move forward in order to in-depth explore the questions this observation brings over the constitution and maintenance of the self, and rather remains bound to the discussion about the link between creativity and the formation of body image. By thinking both with and against Joas I argue that, if a truly ecological treatment to the self should not be limited to linguistic interchanges that substantiate human intersubjectivity, it must also not be narrowed down to the mere valuing of corporeal elements linked to the interactive experiences of individuals. It is essential investing in an integrative view between both aspects, so we may contemplate the inseparability of the material and symbolic dimensions in the continuous counterpoint between subjectivity and objectivity in the inner domains of each individual.\nIn addition to the point highlighted by Joas about Habermas, which is extensible to Blumer and Honneth, there are two deficiencies related to the form of appropriation of Mead which can be claimed common to all these four authors. The first one regards the conceptual selection they carried out in Mead’s work in order to integrate sections of it to their own respective synthesis. The absence of the notions of problem and inquiry (both central to pragmatism) in each of those four conceptual cores separates the theoretical analysis of the self from the practical context of its formation, as well as from the (re)constructive work of reflective intelligence in the course of continuous displacements between the worlds of matter and meaning. I shall explore the relevance of this pair of concepts for the reconstruction of Mead herein envisaged later (section two) in this article.\nFor now I will focus on the second common deficiency of the appropriation of Mead by the authors discussed in the current topic, which rests on the interpretative alternative that they followed regarding the inner structure of the self. It is implicit in Joas’ formulation that the maximum participation of materialility within the self occurs when the material world itself is taken as object for the self’s action during the process of consolidation of the bodily unity. Such a lack of consideration with the active role of materiality in human action and subjectivity results from the interpretation of relations between the Meadian concepts of “I” and “me” that was sanctioned by Joas and shared with Blumer, Habermas and Honneth. Both the American and the German authors welcomed into their respective theoretical works a problematic definition which largely reduces the “I” to individual and the “me” to collective personifications within the self.\nThis specific approach to the roles of the “I” and the “me” in Mead’s self has been called into question by Markell (2007) in the wake of a critique to what he understands as a disabling feature of Honneth’s theory of recognition. The main line of his argument (Markell, 2007: 102-107) lies on the proposition that the definition of recognition as necessary crossing point for the transformation of personhood from something potential to actual means the submission of its self-realization to an external authority. According to Markell (2007: 112- 114, 125-128), this problem derives from the reifying reading of the “I” and the “me” that Honneth made of Mead . Such an approach defines these two concepts as clearly different and counterposed agencies. On the one hand, the “I” would encompass an irreducible individuality, with nature similar to the unconsciousness of psychoanalysis and whose contingency and creativity would represent the potential of renovation. On the other hand, the “me” would be formed by a collective force, a habitual agent that is transposed from the community to the individual in order to censor its “I”. Honneth would not be alone in this interpretation of the Meadian self, for both Habermas and Joas would share with him the idea that the “I” is “[…] something like a source or seat within the individual of creativity, novelty, spontaneity, or resistance to social norms.” (Markell, 2007: 112-113, emphasis in original)2.\nAs pointed out before, Blumer’s understanding on the matter is not distant to that of the Frankfurtians. While acknowledging an ambiguity in the form Mead used the two terms, the sociologist sees the “I” as that thing that brings into the self “[…] expression and release to organic impulse and tendency […]” and the “me” as something that “[…] reflects the attitude of the community […]” (Blumer, 2004: 65-66).\nFor the purposes of the present discussion, the main problem with relating the “I” and the “me” in this way is that it compromises the linkage between Mead’s social psychology and his reflections on perception and the human engagement with matter present in his theory of the act. The delimitation of the self to a symbolically mediated dialogue between a radically individual agency and an interiorized force representing society (in its minimal definition of a collective of individuals) rules out the incidence of the material dimension of human experience on the production of subjectivity. If, as stated by Mead (2011 [n.d.]: 27), “the relations of the environment and the individuals is one of mutual influence.”, 2 Markell (2007: 112) recalls that for Habermas (1992: 180) “[…] the “I” appears on the one hand as the pressure of presocial, natural drives, and on the other hand as the impulse of creative fantasy […]” while for Joas (1985 [1980]: 118) it represents “[…] the endowment of the human being with impulses.”. Despite not identifying such impulses with “[…] some natural compulsion […]”, Joas (1985 [1980]: 118) sees them as unceasing individual drives, finding “[…] expression in fantasies […]”.\nit is necessary to recognize that the interpersonal relations of the self traverse and are traversed by constellations of physical entities. The expansion of the ecological view of Mead’s concept of self can contribute to a more complex and environmentally promising version of his idea of subjectivity.\n\nThe materiality of the “I” at the confluence of self and act 2.1. – Actuality, materiality and the “I” Blumer’s observation about the ambiguity of Mead’s utilization of the “I” and the “me” in his own discussion on the self should not be overlooked. In fact, the problematic understanding of the two concepts portrayed in the last section does not lay roots either in symbolic interactionism or critical theory’s incorporation of Mead, but in Mead’s own writings, on the polyphony he adopted to treat both concepts along his career. There are basically two forms which Mead dealt with the dynamics of the “I” and the “me”. Later in his work, the idea of counterposed individual and social agencies within the self predominates.\n\nThis version has prevailed in his canonization in sociology and sustains the hegemonic interpretation of the Meadian self, as we have seen in the previous section. But another interpretation of the conceptual pair, more aligned with the pragmatism of James and Dewey, finds substance in Mead’s early discussions on the self (Mead: 1903, 1912, 1913)3. It is the intent of the present section to show that this alternative, counter-hegemonic interpretation of the “I” and “me” dynamics is more suitable for dealing with the material properties of subjectivity and, therefore, to serve as starting point for a sociological reconstruction of Mead concerned with an ecological conception of the self.\nSome years ago, Markell (2007) took a stance adopted later by other authors (Silva, 2007: 106-107; Cook, 2013) and set forth a diligent rescue of Mead’s earlier conception of the “I” and the “me”. More specifically, Markell has reclaimed Meads’ articulation (1903: 101- 102) between the original Jamesian formulation of the self, which is constituted by the pure 3 Mead clearly adheres to this approach in texts such as The Definition of the Psychical, The Mechanism of Social Consciousness and The Social Self, all published during the two first decades of the 20th century. In Mind, Self & Society, which is composed mainly of notes taken from Mead’s lectures in Chicago during 1928, the two interpretations of the “I” and the “me” contents coexist. Markell (2007) and Cook (2013) explore the contrast between them in detail.\nego (“I”) and the empirical self (“me”), and the proposition by Dewey (1896: 364) that stimulus and response do not have separate and empirically definable contents, since they are rather referentially composed and only distinguishable through the function they fulfill in the coordination of the sensory-motor circuit.\nIn this specific formulation, Mead concludes that the self is a continuous encounter, in the flow of the individual’s experiences, between subjectivity and objectivity as phases, i.e. aspects4, of its understanding about the world and about itself. The self’s interaction with the rest of the individuals’ internal and external experience field is particularly dynamic in situations when uncertainties break that flow and disrupt the constitution of the object of action, a process which Dewey has called “disintegration” (Mead, 1903: 101). Within this individual innerscape, the subjective aspect of the self is given by the “I”, the “[…] reconstructive activity […]” (Mead, 1903: 109, emphasis added) responsible for the emergence of new objects in action, which takes place in the “[…] very process of replying to one’s own talk [… through] the gestures, the symbols, that arise in consciousness” (Mead, 1912: 406, emphasis added). Based on such a conception, the “I” is configured as the transitive element of the “stream of consciousness” that links different objective experiences and gives them a singularizing touch, a particular inward coloring that confers to the individual a sense of existential continuity (James, 1955 [1890]: 159). Therefore, the “I” is responsible for the subjective synthesis between an individual’s reflections and feelings by generating a sense of unity and sameness that supports its personal identity (James, 1955 [1890]: 214-216). The “me”, in its turn, emerges as the objective aspect of the self, which delimits, within this field of experience, the elements that can be (re)constructed as objects to the individuals’ action through its assumption of the attitudes of others with reference to oneself. Briefly, the “I” is the activity, the “actual response”, which is provided by the self to a problem caused by the disruption of an object (Mead, 1967 [1934]: 277); the “me” is the objectivity of experience introduced to the self when it assumes the attitudes of others (Mead, 1967 [1934]: 175, also see Markell, 2007: 125-127).\nIt is important to distinguish Markell’s distancing from the hegemonic interpretation of the internal structure of Mead’s self from the approach offered by Lewis (1979). Like Markell, Lewis also opposes the assumption that the “I” is an organically composed portion of the self with entity-like properties and, conversely, treats it as the self’s 4 Based on the Meadian vocabulary, the word “phase” does not necessarily regard a stage belonging to some sequential teleological order. Its use is not different from that of the word “aspect” (Silva, 2008: 90-91).\nform of response in communication. However, seeking what he calls a “social behaviorist” approach of the self, Lewis points out that the “I” is the predominantly overt response, the “[…] observable activity which is attended to by both the self and the other.” (Lewis, 1979: 269). He then offers an objectivist version of the “I” by basically excluding its presence in thought and by wiping out the subjective core of intimacy envisioned by Mead’s early writings from its response.\nWith traces of Dewey, one of the main effects of this counter-hegemonic understanding about the inner structure of the self lies on the fact that only the roles played by “I” and “me” can be respectively identified through exclusively individual and social properties; their content, however, is interchangeable (Markell, 2007: 128; Cook, 2013: 121- 124). As suggested by Markell (2007: 128), Mead’s assertion that the reconstructive activity of a present “I” ends up, retrospectively, integrating the objectivity of a future “me” (Mead, 1913: 374, 1967 [1934]: 174) also works in reverse. From this reasoning we conclude that the adoption of the attitude of the other by the individual as its response derives from a form of exercise, rather than necessarily from a drawback, of its individuality. The very act of responding, whether with or against society, is a manifestation of the “I”. Consequently, the same image or representation crossing one of the components of the “I”-“me” pair may come to attend the other. The only variation in those elements will be observed in the type of their functional participation in this reconstructive inner move, whether stimulus or response.\nThis approach is essential for us to understand the material dimension of the self. In order to advance in this direction, it must be specified that, due to the social treatment Mead gives to ontogenetic development, he sees the initial contact with the material world as the consolidation of the intersubjective cognitive mechanism in the individual. The physical object is the abstraction of the social object (Mead, 1972 [1938]: 190). Therefore, the physical thing always enters the experience of a person through the resistance awakened by the friction between that thing and the person’s physical organism. This resistance allows the identification of something substantial in the object, which is not necessarily a personality, but an interior, an “inside” that gives physical responses (thickness, roughness, rigidity…) to the frictional stimulus that, in its turn, is transported to the self and assumed by it through the objectivity of the “me” (Mead, 1972 [1938]: 109-110, 143-144, 152, 186-187, 191-196, 212- 213, 429-431). Devoid of communicative capacity, the resistance provided by the physical object to the human body is the equivalent to its voice in the Meadian interactive structure, so that we talk with things through their ledges, crests, and folds. Resistance also implies cooperation (Mead, 1972 [1938]: pp.108-110). Therefore, by drawing upon a vocabulary influenced by contemporary pragmatic sociology, I can state that, in affinity with Mead, the self is not only buttressed by conventional supports of action (Dodier, 1993), but also by material supports that are brought to its inner realm in the course of its interactions in a world full of physical objects.\nOnce inside the individual’s inner constitution, sensations caused by material supports interact with the universe of language and stir up representations and images stocked in a repertoire of memories built from past experiences: “The image, functionally defined, is then a content that, in terms of past experience, has served as a solution of the problem set in the form of the sensation” (Mead, 1904: 605, also see 1912). By standing before the ecological composition of the problem it faces and the updated version of its self (which is likely the carrier of a new, previously absent, memory), the individual’s response (which exercises the singularity of its “I”) can give rise to new images, i.e., new symbolic interpretations of those materially experienced sensations. My point in here does not lie on the precedence of materiality’s magnitude in comparison to the symbolic dimension of Mead’s pragmatism. I rather shine light on the way Mead is sensible to the reciprocity between the material and the symbolic. Significant symbols and physical resistances meet each other through the communicative work of thought, so that symbols find ballast in material supports and physical resistances acquire meaning from conventional references.\nThe discussion indicates that creative action benefits, on the one hand, from the situational variability set by the flux of experiences and, on the other, from the reconstructive work of the “I”-response, which expresses the individual’s volitions and goals in the space between an old reality that became obsolete, and a new reality yet to be defined (Mead, 1972 [1938]: 34-35, 115). By associating the “I” and the “me” with the creativity found in the resolution of problems set by interactions between people and things, we get to the vertex between the theories of self and the act.\nA few systematic words about the act are relevant at this point. Its substantial elaboration is found on The Philosophy of the Act, which is a posthumous compilation composed of writings where Mead was under the advanced influence of Alfred North Whitehead’s objective relativism. The act is an activity of practical ontology wherein human beings socially set the sense of reality by means of the convergence between their signifying abilities and the material properties of the natural world throughout a spatiotemporal axis.\nMead analytically distinguishes the act into four phases: 1) impulse, when sensations experienced by the individual start the first levels of the construction of a response that lasts the whole trajectory of the act; 2) perception, when, at distance, the object occupying the center of the act starts to be outlined after being associated with that initial sensation; 3) manipulation, when distance gives way to contact and a conscious analysis is exerted over the object; 4) consummation, when the construction of response is concluded and brings along a qualification cast upon the object (Mead, 1972 [1938]: ch.1).\nThe different stages of the act encompass the previously mentioned concepts of problem and inquiry. By drawing upon Dewey’s idea about the disintegration of the object, Mead (1972 [1938]: p.6) defines the problem as the “[…] lack of adjustment between the individual and his world”. It occurs in the context of the act due to the development of the incompatibility between the response provided by the individual and the demands it deals with after receiving a given stimulus. This situational mismatch breaks the flow of the act.\nThe reconstructive work that starts at this point follows the inquiry form, which experimentally analyzes data about the problematic situation in order to reduce incongruous or ambiguous information, to formulate new hypotheses for the solution of the problem, and to test such hypotheses by checking whether the paused act has been restored, or not (Mead, 1972 [1938]: 82-83; also see Cook, 1993: 177).\nA displacement occurs within two gradients throughout this inquiry. The first gradient is related to spatiotemporal proximity, as the examination of an object, whose initial stimuli are always felt at distance, depends on direct contact with the inquirer for effective experimentation. The second one concerns cognitive formality, as individuals move from a spontaneous relationship with the world around them, which Meads calls immediate experience, to the rationalized attitude of a reflected analysis, when conscience is already oriented towards the manipulation phase in order to experimentally test the components of the problem at hand (Mead, 1932: 133-139, 1972 [1938]: 13-16).\nThese two movements influence the inner configuration of the inquirer’s self as it goes through different situations. The objective stimulation (“me”) and the response (“I”) are gradually defined throughout the double displacement caused by the inquiry in the course of the act, from its initial stage (when immediate experience prevails) to the full establishment of reflected analysis (which takes place in manipulation). When reflected analysis is accessed, self-consciousness and awareness about objects adjacent to the self, which are based on a rationalized form of problem appreciation, are quite well-focused. At phylogenetic level, obtainment of rational problem solving does not result from the rupture with a state prior to conscience, but unfolds from it, in a dependent fashion, following the emergence of the significant symbol (Mead, 1922: 160, 1925: 271, 1967 [1934]: 68-82; Silva, 2008: 121-122). When it comes to the individual level, the theory of the act suggests that, as soon as the basis of one’s self is formed, the expression of the analytical reflection about an object in the field of experiences is situational and progressive, so that there is no interruption in thought, but continuity between rationality and the most intuitive forms of engaging in the world. Thus, we observe that the reconstruction of external data sets the “I” and the “me” in motion, and that this process will reflect on the interior domain of the self.\nThe self as inquirer also reconstructs its own inner constitution through its relations with the objects around it.\n2.2. Perspectives and prehensions In the transactions with the world sketched above the individual only has access to the common ground of reality through its own perspective. The idea of perspective has noteworthy presence in the work developed by Mead in the last decade of his life. Its mobilization represents Mead’s attempt to combine his pragmatist naturalism to the relational metaphysics of Whitehead (Mead, 1925: 259-260, 1932: 161-163). In a quite concise fashion, a perspective can be defined as the product of perception spatiotemporally originated from a percipient event that finds itself in relation to a consentient set, i.e., an environment comprising relevant objects concerning the existence of that perceiving entity (Mead, 1925: 256, 1932: 161-175, 1972 [1938]: 100ff). Different perspectives developed throughout the act are concentrated either in a prospective unity, as the promise of a future trajectory, or in a retrospective manner, in the consummation phase, when the act acquires evaluative character (Mead, 1934: 162, 1972 [1938]: 134). After all, reality is the product of a relational organization of perspectives, and individual human subjectivity is part of nature’s objectivity because it is a concrete datum produced within the interchange of organism and environment (Mead, 1972 [1938]: 163).\nMead’s borrowing of the concept of perspective is essential for the present articulation of his theories of self and act. As we know, the philosopher points out that the self benefits from inquiries conducted by the individual on its own inner affairs and problems, which are intersubjectively developed throughout relations with the external environment (Mead, 1913: 378-379, 1967 [1934]: 38, 97-100, 119-124, 177, 188, 216, 254, 274-281, 308, 376, 1972 [1938]: ch.1, 5). Conversations internal to the self sustain thought as a reconstructive activity enabling the individual to set up the self-perspective that defines its singularity (Mead, 1967 [1934]: 254, 308). Thus, Mead (1925: 259-260) understands that “[…] each individual has a world that differs in some degree from that of any other member of the same community, [and] that he slices the events of the community life that are common to all from a different angle from that of any other individual.”. The angles provided by the perspectives of each percipient event produce a stratified reality that comprises nature itself (Mead, 1932: 171).\nBy taking part in continuous processes of relational entanglement of viewpoints that comprise nature, the self has to deal with the material dimension of perspectives from a whole set of entities it interacts with in space and time. The articulation between the concepts of perspective and prehension in Whitehead’s philosophy helps us better understanding materiality’s relevance for the internal construction of individuality in Mead’s work.\nAccording to Whitehead (2011 [1925]): 86, 1978: 18ff), prehension is a mode of perception that takes shape through apprehension, whether cognitive or not, of a given actual entity over another. We do not find in it a simple extension of a being over another, or even an aggregate formed by the sum of two, or more, entities. In the formation of a prehensive unity, Whitehead (2011 [1925]): 81) sees the transperspective complexity of reality with the interpenetration of aspects among all beings composing a totality. Yet, due to its “vector character” (Whitehead, 1978: 19-20), prehension is the form through which an entity can extend itself to others, involve and be involved by them and express its singularity to the external environment. In short, there is no individuality without interdependence between the different perspectives observed in the same universe.\nIn Mead’s work, aside brief mentions in The Philosophy of the Act (1972 [1938]: 147, 202), there is a relevant reference to the concept of prehension in his essay The Objective Reality of Perspectives, published originally in 1926 and later compiled in The Philosophy of the Present. In such reference, Mead makes it clear that, from his view, the way how individuals deal with the common environment cannot be separated from the perspectives they built over themselves within their inner scopes: The consentient set is determined by its relation to a percipient event or organism. The percipient event establishes a lasting character of here and there, of now and then, and is itself an enduring pattern. The pattern repeats itself in the passage of events.\nThese recurrent patterns are grasped together or prehended into a unity, which must have as great a temporal spread as the organism requires to be what it is, whether this period is found in the revolutions of the electrons in an iron atom or in the specious present of a human being. Such a percipient event or organism establishes a consentient set of patterns of events that endure in the relations of here and there, of now and then, through such periods or essential epochs, constituting thus slabs of nature, and differentiating space from time. This perspective of the organism is then there in nature. (Mead, 1932: 162, emphasis added) Because it is a perceptual apprehension that is not reduced to cognitive intercourses between entities, prehension immediately refers us to processes of contact present in the flow of Mead’s act, from the impulse phase to the consummation phase. However, the excerpt above indicates that, according to Mead, by apprehending objects through such a process, a subject is simultaneously setting in motion the prehensive unit of its own self. This unity is built through the interaction of the individual with its consentient set, as different response patterns (elaborated in the interaction between “I” and “me” and later translated into a new mnemonically reconfigured “me”) are temporally accumulated and “grasped together or prehended” as the continuity of its being. This takes us back to James’ influence upon Mead’s initial phase, in particular to the proposition of personal identity as the subjective synthesis of experiences. By dialoguing with this reference it is possible to see in the context of interior problematic situations the “I” and the “me” engaging in a process of inner prehension, in which each of the two elements strives to seize the other from their own perspective, the result of this transaction being the personal configuration of the self. This means that the self derives from the crossing of perspectives between subjectivity and objectivity in the context of mind, where the “I” and the “me” seek to grasp one another 5.\nBy looking at this topic through such lenses, excerpts where Mead states that “The active individual [the “I”] finds in this object individual [the “me”] and its world the conditions under which its action may take place” (2011 [n.d.]: 31, emphasis added) can be interpreted as indicating the possibility that material supports from the field of experiences contribute to the consolidation of the posture of the “I”-response in the temporal flow, not 5 The conception of “I” and “me” as perspectives is also present in Bolton (1981). However, while I follow Whitehead’s definition of the concept, Bolton (1981: 249) suggests a simplified version of perspective as “[…] a symbolically organized mode of orienting oneself toward a situation […]”.\nonly to the configuration of a “me” an organic and naturally individual “I” presents itself to.\nIf, as suggested by Markell, the subjective self encompasses in its transitivity the generalized social attitudes brought along by the objective self, it does the same thing with the material impressions left by contact with physical objects. Matter is not simply an input that passively receives directions from the individuality of the self; it effectively acts upon this individuality, by influencing it through the game played between resistance and cooperation, which is especially observed in manipulation. The transitive state of the stream of consciousness composing the “I” can be supported either by the representational, imagistic and normative conventions of social relations or by the physical contours of the world in order to give its touch of singularity to the self. We seek and take hold of the perspective of an object, prehending its “inside”, just as we seek and take hold of the other in social conduct during the making of our own behavior. The ledges of things are as important for the definition of the response of the “I” in the subjective conformation of our actions as the social expectations of our human peers: “By acting as the object will act […]” says Mead, “[…] we realize the hardness of the object and do not run our heads against it.” (1972 [1938]: 107). We conclude that matter takes part not only in the formation of an individual’s corporal self-image, as Joas points out, but also in the entire introspective process of problem solving that feeds its self- understanding. As Mead himself has stated (1926: 382), that object we lay our hands over is turned into a material to build the world of our heart’s desire and dreams.\nThe interpretation built throughout this section made Markell’s rescue of the pioneer version of “I” and “me” meet Mead’s Whiteheadian reflections, and from there extracted the newly proposed approach of the material supports of the self. In important points, it contrasts with the view defended by Rosenthal and Bourgeois (1991). These authors have accessed Mead’s work by making the effort to make him closer to Merleau- Ponty (Rosenthal and Bourgeois, 1991: 103ff). In their theoretical convergence, they do not adhere to the counter-hegemonic definition of the “I” and “me” concepts, and it leads them to two important mistakes. Firstly, according to Rosenthal and Bourgeois, “I” and “me” do not fully take part in the reconstructive process of the problematic experience, because the disintegration of the object would also cause the transitory disintegration of the relationship between these two components of the self. During the first moments of reconstruction, the individual would only count on the fundamental subjectivity of the “concrete subject” and on its “lived body” (Rosenthal and Bourgeois, 1991: 106), notions taken by the pair of authors from Merleau-Ponty as sources of bodily intelligence. Secondly, because Rosenthal and Bourgeois do not assume the “I” as intrinsically associated with the response activity, they do not see the complex, continuous and incremental relationship between its role in the structure of the self and the material supports of action. According to them, “I” and “me” only return to the scene after the establishment of conscious reflection, and in there they are added to the dynamics of the concrete subject, which lasts and mediates the interactions of the self with the environment. The continuity of the concrete subject within the self is what would guarantee its exchange with the physical world in a process taking place through a non-thematic internal dialogue wherein the “I” would be experienced, felt as the background of mind, but not made explicit as an object of knowledge (Rosenthal and Bourgeois, 1991:113, 115).\nThis last proposition about a non-rationalized instance in thought actively contributes to the procedural treatment of the Meadian self, which has been designed throughout this paper. Nevertheless, it is worth inquiring: is the deviation through Merleau- Ponty necessary in order to achieve it? My answer is no, and its elaboration helps correcting the two aforementioned problems regarding Rosenthal and Bourgeois’ approach. If we recall the image of the self moving along a gradient of cognitive formality, we observe that the “I” and the “me” are involved in the reconstructive process from its very beginning, when immediate experience prevails. It is at that very moment that both elements express themselves in a non-thematic (following Rosenthal and Bougeois’ denomination), non- symbolic (Blumer, 1969: 8) way or, yet, from another viewpoint, in the manner of what Giddens (1984: 44-45) has called practical conscience, which is found in “[…] circumstances in which people pay attention to events going on around them in such a way as to relate their activity to those events” without, however, “thinking” about what they are doing. In reflective analysis, however, our relationship with the objects grows towards transparency and although still not turned into a theme in direct experience, the “I” finds itself in such circumstances able to support more refined ways of response. We can extract from this reasoning that what Rosenthal and Burgeois attempted to describe by resorting to the external notion of concrete subject can be reached within Mead’s own conceptual universe through the articulation between his theories of the self and the act. Therefore, we understand that, similarly to the symbolic dimension, the material dimension of experience is also part of the prehension of human subjectivity in its different degrees of rationality and intentional clarity, and that it is found both in the objectivity of the “me” and in the reconstructive activity of the “I”.\n\nThe self, pragmatic sociology and the new mastery of nature Different currents of contemporary social theory have recently converged to the appreciation of the ontological dimension of interactive partnerships between humans and other beings. References to an ontological politics (Mol, 1999) or to new materialisms (Coole and Frost, 2010), although quite different from each other, share as common orientation the understanding that definitions of reality are productions traversed by conflicts, disputes and effective transformations. The current section argues that Mead’s pragmatism, mainly his theory of the self as herein reconstituted, offers relevant contribution to the discussion about the ontological twist in the forms of power in contemporary modernity. Furthermore, as announced in the introduction, the theoretical exercise developed throughout this article is aimed at an empirically grounded sociological concern which finds fertile soil for research and reflection in discussions about ontological power. Therefore, in addition to discussing the issue through a Meadian outlook, I will also seize the opportunity to explore in the following pages a new sociological alternative to be integrated into Mead’s conceptual perspective.\n\nMy starting point to deal with these ontological issues is the study by Pellizzoni (2015) about recent reconfigurations in the neoliberal mode of mastery over nature, where he expands previous reflections by Cooper (2008) about the entanglement of knowledge, biotechnology and financial capital6. Pellizzoni describes a paradigmatic shift in the political and economic discourses of capitalism beginning in the 1970s. At that time, the sense of a natural limit to growth was progressively replaced by the proposition of the inexhaustibility of opportunities provided by nature. This new discourse appropriates diagnostics about the complexity of the biophysical world resulting from different sectors of the scientific community and from ecological movements to highlight certain features of environmental processes, such as indetermination and instability. It then generalizes these features in positive manner and depicts the unpredictability of environmental systems as a whole set of possibilities, rather than interdictions, for the fulfillment of human designs. The principle of precaution is then neutralized by the ontological reach of purposeful action, since the attitude to be taken towards risk is not its reduction, but the refinement of interventions in the 6 See Pellizzoni (2015: ch.1) for a comprehensive critical appraisal of post-constructivist/anti-humanist approaches to ontological politics, which are not the focus of the current article.\nbiophysical world. The investment in the figure of indetermination in this new form of mastery over nature reinforces the imaginary of plasticity of reality (Papadopoulos, 2011), which is taken to its last consequences by technological fronts such as geoengineering and biotechnology.\nPellizzoni dialogues, at important aspects, with Boltanski and Chiapello’s (1999) idea about a new moral foundation rising from the establishment of neoliberalism. These two authors suggest that capitalism has overcome the crisis of its industrial period by reconfiguring itself through the cooptation of an artistic critique. Present in several political and cultural movements at the late 1960s, this critical modality used to substantiate demands for mobility, adaptability and, most of all, for flexibility. Once the principle of flexibility was integrated as resource in the entrepreneurial world, the critique that used to call for it was disarmed to a large extent. Pellizzoni (2015: 66) himself points out his affinity with this argument; however, I herein further explore this link by assuming his idea of a new mastery of nature as part of the new spirit of capitalism proposed by Boltanski and Chiapello. Thus, the definition of matter as undetermined source of possibilities, broadly flexible and responsive to human projects, seems to result from a surreptitious response from capitalism to critiques coming from both complexity theorists and ecological movements that, since the 1960s, have drawn attention to the irreducibility of nature to the economic, political and epistemological ventures of that regime. Hence, it can be stated that the capitalist reconfiguration promoted by neoliberalism relied not only on moral supports, as Boltanski and Chiapello have suggested. We find in it the articulation between conventional and material supports in the reformulation of a normativity about the relation between human activity and nature.\nThe ideological reorganization that has promoted this flexibilization of nature in the wake of the formation of a new spirit of capitalism brought to light a new object to human experience. As shown by Mead, this is not sustainable without concrete supports. The neutralization of ecological critique did not occur despite the complexity of nature claimed by scientists and activists, but it precisely resulted from its recognition, since it contributed to the perception about the limitations of the typically industrial form of exploration in face of environmental resistances imposed to human manipulation. The adherence to complexity in the neoliberal layout had the double effect of sophistication of economic interference in nature, on the one hand, and the political emptying of critique (at least to some degree) on the other. Therefore, the development of the new technologies mentioned by Pellizzoni, which also include the ones related to carbon markets and human enhancement, did not happen simply throughout projections of pre-elaborated business models over the biophysical world.\nTheir designers engaged in inquiries that sought analytical contact with the profusion of attributes composing the materials in the center of their attention. By manipulating these objects, they intended to reach their interiors, assume their perspectives and, thus, access the complexity of their constitutions. This means that they understood the ideas by authors such as Morin (2008: 5), about the relationship between knowledge and the environment, but they actively sought to neutralize the critical inclination of such theories in favor of elaborating more creative and efficient forms of extracting economic value from nature. In other words, they relied upon the manifold material supports of nature in order to master it.\nAccordingly, material resistance has acted incisively in the perspectives either of critiques of the industrial mastery of nature and of its reformers. However, materiality does not express itself alone in symbolic mediated social relationships. The concept of complexity was the consummatory, representational form with which this resistance was consolidated as object. But, as we have seen, power relations have marked this adjustment of perspectives between the material world and human agencies. Clear asymmetry is established between these perspectives, because, even if the critical interpretation of complexity keeps on operating, its reformulated version as inexhaustible basis of economic exploitation has all the systemic, institutional and moral support of the new spirit of capitalism.\nBefore I tackle the problem of asymmetries, I shall draw new, pragmatist bases for Pellizzoni’s critique to the new mastery of nature. Based on Heidegger, Pellizzoni (2015: 156-157) defends a fundamental split between being and “thinking”, ontology and epistemology, as the source of the singularity of human existence. Consequently, the new technologies approached by his reflection would be worrying not so much due to the results of their activities, but mainly because they would push the leveling between matter and knowledge. From this viewpoint the corruption of the essence of the human as resident of the world is strengthened, and it leads up to an “[…] instrumentalization of everything [natural] as standing-reserve, governed by relations of efficient causality […]” (Pellizzoni, 2015: 153).\nThrough pragmatist lenses, this line of reasoning is not satisfactory. In the first place because, as seen in the discussion about the symbolic and the material in Mead, for pragmatism both knowledge and matter belong to the domain of practice: thinking is itself a way of acting upon the world (Frega, 2006: 39). Secondly, because it reverses the order of construction of critique (MacGilvray, 2004: 104; Frega, 2006), since its justification is based on the non-contemplation of a principle, in this case, the anthropological proposition of discontinuity between humanity and nature. In order to repel this form of idealism, Dewey- inspired pragmatism, to which Mead was affiliated, emphasizes the need for critique to be experimentally constructed. Critical endeavor should be based on assessments of the consequences of a problem, since the very meaning of the critique’s object is dependent upon such consequences for its process of signification (Frega, 2006: 62-65).\nThe consequences of the new technologies must therefore be the aim of critiques directed to the new mastery of nature. Critical constructions should not aim from the beginning at one-size-fits-all considerations (such as Pellizzoni’s), but instead should proceed modestly in a path guided by inquiry work (Chateauraynaud, 2018). The literature on biotechnology and geoengeneering points out some outcomes of such technologies which are relevant for a critical exercise that sticks to practical consequences as the starting point of judgment. Authors from different, albeit critical, theoretical affiliations (Cooper, 2008; Szerszynski et al, 2013; Demeulenaere, 2014; Pellizzoni, 2015), indicate that the progressive transfer of ontological control from ordinary entities (human or not) to the benefit of power systems that create and administer these technologies is one of the most prominent developments set in motion by both strands of innovation. Inspired by Mead and his Whiteheadian moment, by ontological control I mean the capacity an entity has to apprehend its own constitution as a being in relation to its consentient set and, in the case of humans, to actively inquiry and evaluate objects, including one’s self. Intrinsically linked to the regeneration of the market that has emerged after the global crises of the 1970’s, the new mastery of nature propels a gradual colonization of experience by the economy at “[…] the genetic, microbial, and cellular level, so that life becomes, literally, annexed within capitalist processes of accumulation.” (Cooper, 2008: 19).\nHowever, if Mead did not fully disregard the subject of power, it is true that his liberal normativity has limited his view to dialogical forms of conflict resolution (Silva, 2008: ch.15). Regarding this problem, it is essential extending to Mead the observation by MacGilvray (2004: ch.5) about the Hegelian “extrapragmatic roots” of Dewey’s political theory. Similarly to Dewey, Mead understands that the democratic dynamics of collective life is organized by the teleological harmonization of individual orientations, and that it takes place through communicative processes that integrate the multiple selves into their communities. There is insufficient room in his work to the discussion about inequality, violence and domination, which comes about the reduction of autonomous space for the production of perspectives in favor of hegemonic apprehensions.\nThis characteristic of Mead’s thinking emphasizes the difference between his social philosophy and an empirically oriented sociological approach and casts light upon the value of endeavors made by the authors present in the first section of the paper in order to remold the pragmatist’s conceptual force with sociological design7. As we have seen, however, those theoretical constructions suffer from problems which inhibit a satisfactory account of the self according to the ecological view guiding the present study. A final step in the reconstruction of Mead put forward by this article then lies in the task of finding a new base to synthetically house his perspective in the sociological discipline. After ruling out the most prominent options I suggest that a particular approach within contemporary pragmatic sociology, the one advanced by Francis Chataeauraynaud, presents itself as a promising candidate. In addition to his participation in pragmatic sociology’s active claim of classical pragmatism’s legacy in the beginning of the 2000’s (Chateauraynaud, 2004), Chateauraynaud’s theoretical work stands out for highlighting the intertwining between discursivity and materiality in the conduction of inquiries of both ordinary and expert profile.\nIn order to fill the Meadian gap on violence and domination, I shall introduce the concept of ascendancy (emprise) as understood by Chateauraynaud (2015, Chateauraynaud and Debaz, 2017), in the context of his approach to Foucauldian bio-power from the standpoint of pragmatic sociology. What Chateauraynaud defines as ascendancy is an intense form of asymmetry, non-hierarchical, diffused through networks, based on legitimacy and realized by the way of the biasing of actors’ perceptions (Chateauraynaud and Debaz, 2017: 235). An actor gains ascendancy over others by indirectly influencing their behavior, by conquering their “territories of experiences” (Chateauraynaud, 2015: 9), and, finally, by managing the conformation of problems that are elaborated there, as well as the flow of inquiries conducted to solve them. This discussion is substantiated by the concept of grasps (prises) observed throughout Chateauraynaud’s work. By drawing upon it, the author explores the ontoformative power of convergences between representations and material 7 Mead’s image as an armchair philosopher is not accurate, for he was not entirely distant from empirical practice (Huebner, 2014: ch.2-3). However, he never devoted himself to the elaboration of a specific methodology for empirical social research.\nperception (Bessy and Chateauraynaud, 1995; Chateauraynaud and Debaz, 2017: 606-607).\nGrasps are products of human agency in its attempt to elaborate definitions over objects and processes in a universe that is as material as hermeneutical.\nIt is relevant to point out the proximity between the concepts of grasp and prehension, as well as the scarce presence of Whitehead in the work by Chateauraynaud, which also holds true regarding Mead (Mello, 2019: 173)8. In the present article I address the confluence among Mead, Whitehead and Chateauraynaud in order to propose that the processes encompassed by the concept of prehension must be incorporated by the concept of grasp. This is, accordingly, the centerpiece of the synthetical movement bringing together Mead and Chateauraynaud. At this point of the article, I must introduce an analytical distinction between inner and outer grasps9. The basic difference between them is determined by the object of each one: in the former, internal affairs experienced by an actor are the main object, while in the latter the object lies outside the actor’s innerscape. In empirical reality a clear distinction between inner and outer grasps is not possible. We may think of them as interchangeable and communicable analytical perspectives, one directed to the study of problems and inquiries within the courts of the self, the other focused on social and environmental problems which different selves take part in.\nWhen it comes to human reflexivity, outer grasps are processes of ontological characterization of objects the actors interact with in their environments. Their existence implies the operation of inner grasps, because the same interaction promotes, at a greater or lesser degree, the reorganization of the self through the “me” and the “I”, which are responsible for conducting into interiority the material and conventional supports at stake in the resolution of the experienced problem and for the manifestation of the active element responsible for the personal mark in the subject’s response, respectively.\nInner grasps are in motion when the individual presents itself as its own object, when its own self occupies the center of the problems and inquiries it experiences at a given moment. On such occasions, the greatest test put to the self lies on coping with the problem rising within the “enduring pattern” shaping the individual, to grasp issues affecting its 8 Indeed, this similarity is suggested by the long excerpt from Mead quoted above. We may elaborate from it an image of prehension as the gripping movement of a hand that tactfully affords a sense of continuity between what is sensed in one of its regions and what lies in its opposite area.\n9 See Mello (2017) for the initial definition of inner and outer grasps regarding collective subjectivities.\nBesides concentrating on individual subjectivity, the present article dives much deeper in Mead’s work in order to substantiate the pair of concepts.\ninmost sphere by the “lasting character of here and there, of now and then” built along its biographical trajectory. Referring back to the Jamesian Mead (1903; James, 1955 [1890]: 213ff), we may state that, by holding an inner grasp, a person is apprehending its scope of memories, expectations, ideas, emotions, perceptions, and actions, whether they are informed by material or conventional supports, in a specific perspectival conformity that maintains its sense of intimacy and inner correspondence along an ever-changing relational existence with itself and the environment. Not only grasps over external objects, i.e. outer grasps, are compromised in contexts of ascendancy. Inner grasps are loosened, one’s ontological control over its own self is weakened, and an asymmetry is installed to favor other parties. Chateauraynaud’s sociology benefits from this procedure by accessing stronger terrain in order to deal with transactions between subjectivities and externalities sustaining generative existential processes. By taking this step we enable the concept of grasp to work as the existential pillar of a pragmatic sociology of interiority10.\nTwo important topics must be addressed regarding this Meadian-inspired formulation of the inner grasp. The first one is related to the compatibility between synthesis and disruption in the work of the “I”. The “I” may act as a disruptive force as the individual sees itself from a new angle during the self-inquiry engaged by it in the context of a problematic experience. However, a synthetical movement still guides it, as it seeks to leave behind the existential discomfort set in place once a problem has been established. Thus, disruption has to do with the contrast between the contents mobilized in the course of self- inquiry and the initial frame of the problem one is experiencing11.\nThe second topic complements the first and resumes the issue of the tension between the “I” and the “me” as approached towards the end of the previous section. As stated at that moment, both phases strive to grasp each other in the context of inner problematic situations. Chateauraynaud’s pragmatic sociology brings substance to this 10 In sociology, Thomas and Znaniecki (1918-21) were pioneers in developing a biographical analysis of the individual “life-organization” inspired by the legacy of pragmatism. Strauss (1959), in his turn, clearly borrowed the pragmatist conceptions of problem and inquiry (although without explicit reference to them) for analyzing self-identity through his discussion of “self-appraisals”. Corrêa (2021) has similarly followed this path recently, also proposing a dialogue between classical pragmatism and contemporary pragmatic sociology.\n11 Some complementary observations on this topic: 1) By “existential discomfort” I mean a form of dissatisfaction untied to any specific state of emotion. In light of this, peace, stillness and joy may be sources of existential discomfort just as unrest, suffering or misery; 2) given 1, by mentioning a movement away from such discomfort I evidently do not rely on the structural-functional argument of a constant human necessity of stability and social conformation, as conformation itself may be the cause of discomfort in the first place; 3) the synthetical movement set forth by a problem is not rectilinear or predictable; 4) because of 3, the exercise of a synthetic movement does not guarantee at all that a reconstruction will come to term, since a person may found itself in a continuous process of self-search without ever achieving a stationary solution.\ndiscussion. With his version of the concept of tests (épreuves), pervasive in pragmatic sociology, Chateauraynaud (2004: 169) invites us to think that the disintegration caused by a problem can not make disappear entirely the material and symbolic properties of beings involved in it. This reasoning is fully in line with Mead’s theory of the act. We may then assert that in order to conduct reconstruction and (re)gain an inner grasp, the “I” must deal with both cooperation and resistance offered by elements in the objective phase of the self.\nIn order to grasp oneself, a person must go through tests whose content is linked to the configuration of the problematic experience12. It is the result of these tests, in which the “I” and the “me” communicate more or less contentiously, which will determine the amount of permanence or transformation of the self. Like outer grasps on collective problems, inner grasps are also constantly put to the test by what one experiences in social situations.\nBased on such an articulation, we have observed that the bias caused by asymmetric ascendancy produces its effects on the relations of the self with its own internal province and with its environment; its effects stretch down to the self’s very sense of reality developed in its interactions with the other selves and the world. The ontological politics found in the new mastery of nature projects itself over the territories of experience of different strata of the world population, not just as a new grammar of relations with the environment, but, equally, as an existential prescription that naturalizes flexibility as a principle for the orientation of the self. The dynamics between the “I” and the “me” pointed out in the second part of this text is fully connected to this process.\nThe internal components of the self are also coveted by this form of existential ascendancy, since its goal is to influence the behavior of social actors. In order to further assess this assertion, I must take the case of climatic change policies mentioned by Pellizzoni (2015: 4): according to him, the new approach towards nature becomes normative when, among other factors, it boosts the overlapping of the principle of adaptation to that of mitigation in these regulations. This process leads to the normalization of uncertainty and spreads the imperative of flexibility to adapt to new situations as a form of individual responsibility in face of risks. The emphasis on the concept of adaptation, as it was molded and disseminated by multi-lateral actors, such as the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), shifts the focus of measures regarding risks from a paradigm of stability to that of adequacy to environmental instabilities (Jennings, 2011: 12 Périlleux (2001) speaks of “self-tests” (épreuves du soi) in an approach closely linked to that of Boltanski and Chiapello (1999).\n240). According to Grove (2014: 204), the adaptation discourse in contemporary climate- change and disaster policies heads towards the production of forms of life “appropriate” to contexts under risk, which are responsive to them and capable of forging their actions based on signs of threat. Just as assessed by Jennings (2011), the study by Grove suggests that, oftentimes, one of the consequences of implementing adaptation policies is the establishment of asymmetric relations between government and local populations that atomizes social responsibility for risks by transferring it from the state to the individual level. Once exposed to educational and qualification programs and to awareness initiatives, individuals are expected to engage in reviews of their own attitudes in order to make themselves pliable to the contingency of milieus (Grove, 2014: 203ff). An adaptable self is then vaunted, flexible enough to adequate to, and even to profit from, the unavoidable indeterminacy of nature and to be responsible enough to know that its fortune in this risky setting depends mainly on its individual behavior.\nIt is worth highlighting that such a critical consideration about the concept of adaptation refers to its hegemonic, contemporary version, which is consolidated in the official circles of the United Nations and national governments. The term presents a polysemic spectrum, and pragmatism itself houses a conception of adaptation related to its ecological interpretation of agency. The first generation of critical theory clung to a troublesome reduction of such an interpretation as a form of political conformism, when, by talking about adaptation, pragmatists actually “[…] never meant routine and loss of subjectivity but practical innovation, creative solutions to real problems.” (Joas, 1985 [1980]: 83, emphasis in original)13. Based on such logic, and besides the pragmatist difficult relation with conflict that I have herein tried to compensate, adaptation can represent either a way of accommodating to the status quo or to fully transform it. The current hegemonic conception of adaptation can nonetheless be interpreted as a feature to prevent transformation, especially if it is oriented towards a radical revision of risk production in capitalism. Many times, the non-publicized implication of a discourse that advocates for the promotion of empowerment of vulnerable communities, so they can develop their own ways of adaptation, is, in fact, the exclusion of anti-systemic alternatives of response.\nThe flexibilization of life as imperative linked to the new spirit of capitalism brings along a configuration where dealing with risks implies the continuous availability of 13 See Dewey’s (2013 [1934]: 14-15) differentiation between accommodation, adjustment and adaptation and the sociological account of adaptation in contexts of social change in Thomas and Znaniecki (1918-21).\ncognitive and affective arrangements between people and environments. If the new mastery of nature sets a guideline that can lead local actors to lose their grasps over the milieu, it may also promote a forced malleability of life projects, desires and dreams at the inner domains of their selves, which is justified by the need of adequacy to an always mobile horizon of hazards. Based on the conceptual articulation I have addressed earlier, I can talk about the chances of a varying loss not only of outer, but also inner grasps when individuals find themselves under the ascendancy of the hegemonic agenda of contemporary risk policies.\nBy replicating what happens in other neoliberal institutional coordinates (Boltanski and Chiapello, 1999), to the extent that legitimate powers are successful in diffusing the principles of adaptation and flexibilization, it is possible that a tendency for the reduction of autonomous determination of the perspectives of local actors may develop. This is due mainly to the interference in their selves’ inquiry space. The “I” lies in the center of this dynamics of ascendancy, since it is necessary to encapsulate its singularizing activity within a behavioral program ruled by the ethos of flexibility and adaptability. However, due to the striking contingency of the “I”, the logic of adaptation opts for an indirect form of control. It reaches the objective phases (“me”) of its target audience, provides them with justifications for an individualized responsibility towards risk and diminishes the room for autonomous responses of the “I”. This “culture of safety” (Grove, 2014: 205) espoused by many risk reduction official managers, is entangled with the perspective of the ontological instability of the environment, result of material manipulations upon nature’s properties. As a result,, the tests biasing these audiences’ inner grasps towards adaptable versions of their selves are sustained by both conventional and material supports. In the end, we observe that the depoliticizing outer grasps laid by the new mastery of nature upon its resistance to typical industrial exploration are mirrored by the exaltation of a flexibilizing model of inner grasp with the purpose of ascendancy.\nConclusion The discussion about the contemporary ontological politics based on Mead’s philosophy stands out due to the sensibility of his naturalist pragmatism to the entanglement of the natural and the social. With the aid of his perspective we observe that new forms of political coordination of nature derive from reciprocal modifications in perspectives between human communities and the biogeophysical world. With that in view, the integration of subjective processes of the self within a critical appreciation of society cannot dispense with the disclosure of the engines of mesological ascendancy that entertain human relations. Thus, the reassessment of risks as opportunities favors an asymmetric form of ontological flexibilization that affects life from its molecular level to the symbolic exchanges at social plan.\nThroughout the article, Markell’s rescue of James and Dewey’s influence on Mead’s initial definition of the concepts of “I” and “me” have worked as the basis for the reinterpretation of the relationship between materiality and subjectivity in the final, Whiteheadian phase of his work, and it enabled a new outlook over the role of materiality in the composition of the self. This was the background for the articulation between Mead’s pragmatism and Chateauraynaud’s sociology, which proposed the former’s concept of self as the fundament for the pragmatics of interiority envisaged by the latter, rendering it a Meadian twist. By bringing together these two authors, I sought to contribute with an alternative to the hegemonic interpretation of the internal dynamics of the Meadian self in sociology, more sensible to the material contours of subjectivity. What has been developed in this article lays the foundations for this endeavor, which shall be further explored both theoretically and empirically in future occasions. The idea of self-inquiries as one’s attempt to grasp itself may be unfolded both internally, through the access of other regions in the works of its two central authors, or externally, by bringing into its synthesis other references converging to the general conception of self sketched throughout the text.",
