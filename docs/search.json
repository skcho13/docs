    "text": "Abstract\nToward the end of his life, George Herbert Mead developed a theory of perspec- tives that may be used to reinterpret his social, developmental psychology. This paper attempts such a reinterpretation, leading to the emergence of a theory of perspective taking in early childhood that looks quite diff erent from that which is assumed in most extant work in developmental psychology. Theoretical and empirical implications of Mead’s perspectivism and perspective taking are also explored, with particular focus on questions of internalization and agency. In addition, important distinctions are drawn between Mead’s view of human development and most contemporary theories.\nCopyright © 2006 S. Karger AG, Basel\nVarious conceptions of internalization and agency can be found in the contem- porary literature of developmental psychology, but relatively little consensus has been achieved concerning their specifi c nature and role in the development of the minds and selves of human beings during ontogenesis [Chapman, 1999; Martin, Sugarman, & Thompson, 2003; Nicolopoulou & Weintraub, 1998]. Broadly speak- ing, internalization refers to a collection of social, psychological processes whereby public linguistic and other social, relational phenomena somehow are transformed into private cognitive and other psychological phenomena [e.g., Vygotsky, 1934/ 1986]. In similar broad strokes, agency typically is formulated as a kind of self-de- termination that is itself determined by sociocultural and biophysical structures and processes, yet is not entirely reducible to such non-psychological systems [e.g., Bruner, 1990]. In recent years, a number of developmentalists have proposed theo- ries of self-development that assume conceptions of internalization and agency that attempt to avoid overly strong forms of psychological constructivism on the one hand, and overly strong forms of social constructionism on the other [e.g., Bickhard, 2004; Harré, 1998, 2004; Tomasello, 1999]. These theoretical positions understand social interactivity and communication as developmentally indispensable to, and in many ways constitutive of, psychological personhood. Yet, they leave room for the exercise of rational and moral agency, whereby individuals can control (at least to some extent) and be held accountable for their actions. Such views are frequently associated with the theorizing of Vygotsky [1934/1986, 1978], sometimes with the work of Piaget [e.g., Carpendale & Lewis, 2004; Chapman, 1991, 1999], and occa- sionally with the body of ideas articulated by George Herbert Mead [1932/2002, 1934, 1938].\nIn developmental psychology, especially in more recent years, Mead’s interac- tionist view of the self-societal dialectic has been both endorsed as an early relation- al theory of the development of mind and consciousness through participation with others [e.g., Marková, 1987], and derided as a form of social determinism that dis- places genuinely moral and rational forms of human agency [e.g., Davidson & Youniss, 1995]. More recently, Mead’s work has received brief and passing mention in major volumes concerned with the social and cultural origins of human thought, mind, and selfhood [e.g., Hobson, 2002; Tomasello, 1999]. Such differential and ab- breviated treatment is understandable given the well-know diffi culties in interpret- ing Mead’s oeuvre. Much of it is derived from lectures and unpublished fragments that have been preserved and published through the note taking and editing of oth- ers. Mead also seems to have championed somewhat different views in different writings. It is thus not surprising that Mead scholars have offered several interpreta- tions of his work [e.g., Blumer, 1980; Cook, 1993; Gillespie, 2005; Joas, 1997; Wiley, 1995].\nHerein, Mead is interpreted as a perspectival realist who had a great deal to say that is highly relevant to contemporary debates and questions within developmental psychology concerning internalization and agency. In what follows, it will be main- tained that Mead’s theory of perspective taking offers a viable, alternative account of internalization that is both theoretically progressive and empirically suggestive.\nMoreover, this is an account that provides a plausible compatibilist interpretation of agency as both determined and determining, in the societal-personal, co-constitu- tive manner seemingly desired by many developmentalists [e.g., Bruner, 1990; Ro- goff, 1992; Valsiner, 1991].\nConsequently, what follows, while centrally concerned with perspective taking, is not in any way intended as a review of, or detailed commentary on, the vast lit- erature in developmental psychology that is concerned with perspective taking [for this, see recent reviews and commentaries by Chandler, 2001; Flavell, 1992; Menna & Cohen, 1997; Schober, 1998]. Rather, the central intention is to describe Mead’s theory of perspectivism and perspective taking in the context of his social, develop- mental psychology, and to consider some of its possible theoretical and empirical implications for conceptualizing and studying internalization and agency. Unlike most contemporary developmental psychologists, Mead does not treat perspective taking primarily as a signifi cant developmental accomplishment that marks our progress as epistemic agents. Instead, he considers perspective taking as a basic con- dition of our sociality and ontological constitution as agentive selves in interaction with others.\nMead’s Perspective Realism and Theory of Perspectives The term ‘perspective’ was not used by Mead until about 1920, when he began to articulate his mature philosophical position in opposition to traditional meta- physics. In the traditional view, for something to be objective or real, that thing can- not depend on any other thing, but must stand on its own. Mead was concerned that such an assumption relegated many important and infl uential social and psycho- logical entities and processes to the realm of the illusory and imaginary, and threat- ened to sweep social and developmental psychology toward the twin brinks of ideal- ism and solipsism. In developing his theory of the objective reality of perspectives [Mead, 1932/2002, pp. 153–170], Mead was at pains to put our sociocultural and psychological functioning back into the world in such a way that it might be the ob- ject of rigorous scientifi c study and consideration.\n‘In his later years, Mead often used “being in the perspective of the other” in- stead of “taking the role of the other”’ [Miller, 1982, p. 17]. Cook [1993] has noted that Mead came to use the phrases, ‘take the attitude of the other … taking the role of the other,’ and ‘take the perspective of the other … more or less interchangeably’ (pp. 79f). For Mead, our entire human sociocultural and psychological world is real, but perspectival (i.e., dependent on us). Mead defi ned perspectives as orientations within a larger context that arise through, and always remain related to, human con- duct in the world. ‘The perspective is the world in its relationship to the individual and the individual in his relationship to the world’ [Mead, 1938, p. 115]. ‘The world, things and the individual are what they are because of this relation’ [Mead, 1938, p. 215]. When entered into, perspectives are both perceptual and conceptual. Al- though they arise within particular sequences of social interactivity, they are not fi xed to a particular present. As a consequence, once they are experienced, they can be used imaginatively.\nThus, a perspective is an orientation to an environment that is associated with acting within that environment. Perspectives emerge out of activity and enable in- creasingly complex, differentiated, and abstracted forms of activity. Because the hu- man world is a social world, all perspectives arise and are employed within interper- sonal interactivity. Even though perspectives may be elaborated imaginatively and honed refl ectively, they are seeded and maintained through interactions with others.\nThis is not to say that there is no biophysical world that constrains and also enables human interactivity. It is simply to recognize that biophysical conditions, although necessary, are in no way suffi cient for perspectivity of the kind that enables the de- velopment and functioning of social-psychological phenomena like mind and self. It is important to emphasize that for Mead, the taking of perspectives is not primarily an epistemological matter through which we come to understand our world and our selves. Rather, it is an ontological matter. It is by taking perspectives that exist in the sociocultural world in which we are embedded from birth that we come to exist as self-interpreting beings at all.\nSocial acts are collective acts that involve two or more participating individuals, and social objects are collective objects with meanings that can be shared by par- ticipating individuals. Social objects are what they are by virtue of their embedded- ness within the matrix of social acts that makes up the life of a society. Bones of animals become weapons in the experience of early human individuals engaged in social acts of confl ict, and balloons become toys when bounced back and forth be- tween a mother and her child. At a more abstract level, minds and selves also arise out of human interactive activity, especially communicative activity supported by the signifi cant symbols of language. Mead [in Reck, 1964, pp. 134–141] maintains that communication in humans begins, both phylogenetically and ontogenetically, as a conversation of gestures that gradually becomes transformed into a conversation of signifi cant symbols (i.e., language). Signifi cant symbols ‘call out’ in the individual using them functionally similar responses to what they call out in others to whom they are directed.\nTaking the perspective of the other is essential to Mead’s conception of the sig- nifi cant symbol [Gillespie, 2005]. Most importantly for current purposes, signifi cant symbols are not to be understood only as shared, singular perspectives (i.e., as the evocation of the same meaning in different individuals, as in Morris’ introduction to Mead, 1934, p. xxi), but more importantly as simultaneously experienced, dual perspectives. ‘It is through the ability to be the other at the same time that he is him- self that the symbol becomes signifi cant’ [Mead, in Reck, 1964, p. 244]. For example, as I tell what I regard as an amusing anecdote to a friend, I watch his reactions for signs of enjoyment, simultaneously adjusting and embellishing my story, at least in part, on the basis of what I fi nd there.\nWith this in mind, consider Miller’s [1982] statement about the centrality of the signifi cant symbol to Mead’s thought.\nMead’s most profound insight consists in understanding that the signifi cant symbol, the language symbol, consists of a gesture whose meaning is had by both the one who makes the gesture and the other to whom it is addressed. He spent most of his intellectual life unravel- ing this insight. (pp. 10–11) However, as Gillespie [2005] has argued, based on Mead’s later perspectivism, the true importance of the signifi cant symbol with respect to the development of thought, consciousness, and selfhood concerns the simultaneous positioning of the individual within two or more perspectives. It is being in two perspectives at the same time, simultaneously taking multiple positions within meaningful sequences of conduct, that defi nes sociality for Mead. It is within this sociality that mind and self emerge.\nFor Mead, human conduct must be understood as an emergent unfolding of se- quences of social acts within which individuals react to both others and themselves.\nSuch a conception of social conduct makes it possible to understand Mead’s theory of how consciousness and selfhood arise through a graduated, social developmental process of intersubjectivity. It is within interactions with others that infants become other to themselves. They do this by taking the perspectives of others, and then by reacting to the self and other perspectives that emerge within their ongoing interac- tivity.\n‘Internalization’ and Agency within Sociality The self is something which has a development; it is not there, at birth, but arises in the process of social experience and activity, that is, develops in the given individual as a result of his relations to that process as a whole and to other individuals within that process.\n[Mead, 1934, p. 135] What distinguishes the forms of consciousness that can be experienced by the normal, adult human being from the more basic forms of sensitivity to the environ- ment likely experienced by other animals and infants is the refl exivity of the self.\nThis is a refl exivity that only can arise through interactions with others within an ongoing social process. Pre-refl ective consciousness refers to a world that is there, but refl ective consciousness or refl exivity refers to a world as experienced by a self that is capable of being both a subject and an object to itself. The individual becomes ‘an object to himself by taking the attitudes of other individuals toward himself within an organized setting of social relationships’ [Mead, 1934, p. 255].\nBy reinterpreting Mead’s social developmental psychology, as set forth in Mind, Self, and Society and several of his earlier essays, through his theory of perspectives within social conduct, it is possible to arrive at a detailed understanding of what is involved in achieving selfhood, self-understanding, and agency. Such an understand- ing highlights two features of Mead’s theory of perspective taking: (1) the importance of simultaneously being in one’s own and another’s perspective, and (2) the impor- tance of reacting to the multiple perspectives that one is in.\nBeing in Different Perspectives Simultaneously In Vygotsky’s [1978, p. 56] famous analysis of the child’s internalization of the meaning of pointing, he provides a feedback theory in which the mother responds to the child’s reaching by bringing an object closer to the child, thus converting the child’s grasping into pointing. Although feedback theorizing of this kind moves from a dyadic, child-object to a triadic, child-object-other model of explanation, it does not deal adequately or fully with the intersubjective, subject-subject relation [Gil- lespie, 2005]. In this example, the feedback theory does not endow the mother with a perspective that can be taken by the child, and occupied together with the child’s own initial perspective. Consequently, the feedback theory cannot explain adequate- ly how the child becomes other to himself.\nFor Mead, the child displays the meaning of pointing when she is able to re- spond appropriately to the situational pointing of her mother as well as to stimulate herself to act as her mother would act in response to her (the child’s) own pointing gestures. To understand how one might become other to oneself, Mead turned to social conduct, especially to the subject-subject relation, in a manner that brought the perspective of the other into the analysis. What he realized is that from the earli- est days of life, the developing self already is engaging with the perspective of the other in rudimentary social interactions. With this realization, the key question be- came one of understanding how the developing child could begin to experience the position or situation of the other (parent or caregiver) within social interaction. The answer for Mead lay in the young child’s repeated, and somewhat predictable se- quences of interaction with others in which she has exchanged roles and positions (e.g., sometimes passing a ball and sometimes receiving it; sometimes crying and sometimes comforting; sometimes asking and sometimes receiving; sometimes dis- puting and sometimes placating).\nVery early in development, such perspective taking is exceedingly rudimentary, amounting to little more than a pre-refl ective recollection and anticipation of p hases and positions within very simple gestural sequences (e.g., pushing a ball back and forth, with some assistance from a caregiver). However, through repeated social ex- perience of sequences of gestures, responses, and consequences, in interaction with their caretakers, infants gradually comprehend and anticipate the meanings of rou- tine social gestures. They simultaneously build up clearer recognitions of their care- givers and other objects in their micro social environments. Through repetitively shared sequences of interactive gestural activity, young children acquire a primitive sense of gestural meanings and come to distinguish particular social objects like mother and father. They then can begin to develop awareness of their own actions and selves through interactions that use signifi cant symbols, and eventually through more refl ective forms of interpersonal and societal perspective taking [Baldwin, 1986].\nAs Gillespie [2005] makes clear, for Mead the way to understand perspective taking was to stay focused on the social act: A social act refers to a social interaction that has become an institution, with established positions (i.e., buyer/seller, teacher/student, parent/child, boss/subordinate) that are stable over time. The introduction of both time and social structure is a breakthrough. Although the perspectives of self and other within any ongoing social act are necessarily divergent, if one takes into account time and a stable social structure, then it is possible that at some previous point in time, the positions of self and other were reversed. Given this, each par- ticipant in a social act may, by virtue of previous responses while in the position of the other, already possess the attitude of the other … It is because self and other are often in the same situations, or social positions, and acting toward the same objects, that the child comes to acquire the same attitudes that others have. (pp. 27–28) Over time, and in this manner, as the child’s social interactions widen and deepen, she eventually acquires the perspectives of others common to the social pro- cesses and communities in which she participates, thus taking the attitude of what Mead calls the generalized other or generalized others [Cronk, 1973]. This more ab- stracted process of perspective taking eventually can be continued vicariously and imaginatively through engagements with orientations and views available in diverse media including literature and fi lm.\nOnce the child has taken the perspectives of others in the way Gillespie [2005] has described, she only has to react to herself through these perspectives that she previously has engaged in interactions with others. As already hinted, the key here lies in exchanging and reversing roles within sequences of social interactivity, espe- cially in coming to occupy two or more positions or perspectives simultaneously.\nOne major way in which such multiple occupation of perspectives is developed is through play and games, which are characterized by positional exchange, both ac- tual and imaginary. Gillespie [2005] points out that games encourage the simultane- ous evocation of two or more perspectives by (1) providing opportunities for moving between complementary social positions (e.g., receiving and making a pass in a game of football), (2) providing rules that bridge perspectives housed in different positions and situations within the game (e.g., passing and receiving a football in ways that do not run afoul of the off-side rule), and (3) providing a context in which vocal gestures between players can serve to integrate perspectives in an immediately concrete man- ner (e.g., calling for a ‘pass’ and responding to that call). The important point is that it is through repeated and graduated participation in different positions within rou- tine, everyday social interactions (including play and games) that the child is able to take different perspectives, and eventually to occupy different perspectives simulta- neously. Such multiple perspectivity allows the child to be other to herself, so that she is able to react to those very perspectives that now constitute her as a social be- ing (i.e., as a ‘Me’).\nReacting to Perspectives The importance of reacting to the perspectives of others that one has previous- ly experienced in social interactions that have involved reversals of roles and posi- tions should not be underestimated. For Mead, the activity of the self is conditioned by, but not determined by the social situations and processes within which it emerg- es. Human agency is conditional but free. In order for the self to become an object to itself, it is not enough to take the perspectives of others as experienced in one’s past and current history of interactivity. In addition, it is necessary to react to the self that appears in current action and imagination as a consequence of such past engagement. Mead’s self thus has two dimensions or phases: (1) a ‘Me’ that consists in the perspectives of others based on past experience, and (2) an ‘I’ that reacts to the ‘Me’ and the current situation in terms of an imagined future in which the ‘Me’ is restructured. Mead’s distinction between the ‘Me’ and the ‘I’ brings both tempo- rality and sociality to bear on agency. The ‘Me’ is an objective self that contains per- spectives and possibilities for social interaction gleaned from a past history of social interactivity. The ‘I,’ especially in novel and problematic situations, reacts to the ‘Me’ in the immediate moment of action, and, in so doing, enters into a reconstruct- ed ‘Me’ of the next moment, while simultaneously preparing the ground for a newly emergent future ‘I.’ Mead’s conception of emergence [Mead, 1932/2002] is that of a disruption in experience – an impasse in the continuity of passage from the present to the future, which anticipates a more distant future in which harmony will be restored. As Saw- yer [2002, p. 9] recently has pointed out, sociality, or simultaneous positioning with- in different systems and perspectives, was, for Mead, an integral aspect of emer- gence. In particular, emergence is a consequence of occupying perspectives in ways that admit to heretofore unexperienced and unimagined possibilities. However, Mead, unlike many theorists of emergence in contemporary science and social sci- ence, insisted on a social level of reality with unique constitutive powers that was not reducible to biophysical levels of the world [also see Archer, 1995; Bhaskar, 1979; Martin, 2003].\nFor Mead, the immediate moment of action brings together a concern of the present with both recollections of relevant past activity and anticipations of a future in which the concern or problem to which the action of the present is directed is resolved or somehow made manageable. Such concerns typically are emergent in the fi eld of activity, within the ongoing dynamic interplay of social, interpersonal, and personal perspectives. They arise in the immediate context of novel, unpredict- able occurrences that constitute a change in past action sequences and perspectives.\nIf such emergent change were not common, our minds and selves would be deter- mined entirely by our past interactions in our biophysical and sociocultural world, and our worldly conduct would not be punctuated and experienced in temporal terms. It is precisely because of the emergence of change that our temporal experi- ence and agency also arise. Psychological time requires markers, and change sup- plies them.\nTo summarize, Mead’s theory of perspectives treats the taking of perspectives as embedded in, and emergent from, positional exchange and simultaneity within interpersonal interactivity. Mead’s perspective taking arises from participation within, and experience of, different positions and orientations within intersubjective communicative sequences and contexts. It is not a matter of somehow converting social processes to psychological ones, but of coming to participate in social interac- tivity as self-aware psychological persons. Mead never talked about having a perspec- tive on something. One is in a perspective and part of a perspective. A perspective is a relational, not a mental, entity. It is a relation of an individual or group to a situation, with respect to acting in that situation. To understand Mead’s approach to perspective taking, taking must not be given a mentalistic interpretation. More- over, the agency that is exercised by a self-aware psychological person is not deter- mined by biophysical and/or sociocultural factors, but is a reaction of a self-inter- preting being to those perspectives she is immersed in through her ongoing social interactions with herself, others, and the social, cultural communities in which she acts. In short, agency is a reaction to the situation in which one fi nds one’s self, and that situation always is a social situation. For Mead, both selfhood and agency arise developmentally through perspective taking (positional exchange, simultaneity, and coordination) within social acts.\nPerspectival Selfhood in Context Recall that a major rationale for Mead’s perspectival realism was to restore so- cial and psychological phenomena to the world, and to forestall a rush to subjectiv- ism, idealism, and solipsism. By treating social psychological perspectives as both real and emergent, he also hoped to resist reductive forms of social and psychologi- cal theorizing that he viewed as pseudo-scientifi c, in that they inappropriately re- duce, and thereby distort, exactly those entities (like mind, self, and consciousness) that need to be explained. Perspectives, in Mead’s sense, are always in the world.\nIndeed, they make up our social and cultural world. They have an objectivity that derives from the extent to which they are shared and function within our individual and collective experience [Mead, 1938].\nFor Mead, the reality and organization of perspectives is apparent in social con- duct within which the individual and others are immersed in a cooperative process of perspective taking. If a number of others are involved, the individual is able to take the perspectives of all of them, both as individuals and as a collective. She or he is able to do this by understanding what it is that they wish to accomplish – in other words, by comprehending the problematic situation they all confront, and in- ferring a sense of what would constitute a resolution for all concerned. At the begin- ning of interactions with others in problematic circumstances, such a common ele- ment in the perspectives of all participants might be framed as nothing more than the removal of the diffi culty that confronts them all. However, over time, and with accumulated interactions in the problem context through which different actions with respect to the problem are discussed and attempted, the individual is able to enter into the perspectives of others. At the same time, she enters into an emerging, more detailed common perspective as a consequence of her participation in this overall process of problem solving, a process which in turn is nested in the overall social process.\nWhat ultimately organizes these various perspectives is the extent to which they achieve collective support within the problem context and the social process in gen- eral. Since all perspectives are initially, at least to some extent, hypothetical, it is the development and application of perspectives within their contexts that organizes them. Perspectives that are unsuccessful in moving the group toward a resolution of the problem confronting them are discarded in favor of those that yield more suc- cess. Perspectives are organized in terms of their utility and viability across problem situations and distributed among those individuals interactive within them. Such organization and distribution result in a variety of generalized others, depending on the diversity of the social group and community in question. Mead’s generalized oth- ers may be thought of as organizations of perspectives that facilitate awareness of how various attitudes and roles are coordinated within complex social acts. Perspec- tives are social and objectively real in that they both constrain (acting consistently with generalized others in conventional situations) and enable (acting contrary to, or extending generalized others, especially in problem situations where convention- al perspectives fail).\nTo the extent that all emergent, hypothetical perspectives have the potential to become realized in social conduct, especially in problem situations, they are objec- tively in the real world that is the sum total of all perspectives. In Mead’s words, the emergent value which the individual organism confers upon the common world belongs to that world in so far as it leads to its creative reconstruction. In so far as the world is pass- ing into a future, there is an opportunity for that which is not objective to become objective.\n[Mead, 1938, p. 613] For Mead, the relation of an organism and an environment is continuously dy- namic. The natural and social world consists of a multiplicity of perspectives, any one of which may enter into an organism’s fi eld of activity. It is by virtue of the or- ganism’s ability to be several things simultaneously, in the sense of taking on (acting within) two or more different perspectives, that the organism is able to deal with emergent events or novel, unexpected occurrences. Because human persons are themselves social, their perspective taking may be enhanced greatly by communica- tion with others through signifi cant symbols.\nIt is precisely because human individuals are able to take the perspectives of others within the social process that they may acquire selves that are constituted by the perspectives available in their ongoing social encounters. Because social life is dynamically unfolding, the perspectival self is continuously emergent. Nonetheless, such a self is able to achieve suffi cient stability within the larger social process of organized, and potentially objective perspectives so that it can function with some success within the problem contexts that it necessarily will face in the course of liv- ing. As a ‘Me,’ the self consists of perspectival understandings and orientations. As an ‘I,’ the self is an active agent simultaneously occupying situations that have been in one sense determined by the past, but which (because of the ever-present emer- gence of novel circumstances) in another sense are open to determination by the momentary activity of the ‘I’ in the fl eeting present. By being simultaneously present in both of these temporal perspectives, the self is a source of both the achieved wis- dom of the past and the agentive cultivation of the future. Perspectives constitutive of selfhood must be coordinated suffi ciently with other social and interpersonal per- spectives to ensure functional levels of intelligibility and interactivity. However, such required coordination still leaves room for considerable creativity in achieving perspectival coordinations that might prove more functional and inclusive than con- ventionally extant organizations of perspectives [Martin, 2005].\nImplications for Contemporary Theory and Research Perspective Taking as ‘Internalization’ Mead’s theory of perspectives and perspective taking is a participation theory in which the functional meanings, self-other differentiations, and perspectival actuali- ties and possibilities resident in interactivity constitute our minds and selves. On this interpretation of Mead (even though he occasionally uses the term ‘internalization’ himself), there is no need to think of any of these developmental processes as requir- ing empathic or intentional theorizing that involves simulating how one would feel, think, and act in the situations of others, including their mental states. Of course, as developed adults, we are able to do all of these things, but according to Mead, we do not initially learn to do them through developing theories of minds. Such mental feats are products of more basic developmental processes. They are not primary develop- mental processes themselves. To posit them as basic mechanisms of internalization is to assume exactly what needs to be explained. Thus, unlike contemporary versions of theory of mind in developmental psychology [see Carpendale & Lewis, 2004 for a recent critical review], Mead understood interpreting the actions of others as an in- tersubjective process that privileges action with others over introspective thought.\nMoreover, processes like imitation and identifi cation, which many contemporary de- velopmental theorists [e.g., Hobson, 2002; Tomasello, 1999] understand as basic mechanisms of internalization, are treated by Mead as developmental consequences of the kind of participatory positioning and perspective taking he endorsed.\nPossible Theoretical Progress. M ead’s developmental account, as interpreted through his theory of perspectives, runs counter to much contemporary developmental psychology. In particular, it does not talk about the development of general or specifi c theories of mind [e.g., Gopnik & Wellman, 1992], esoteric forms of introspection that might be associated with imaginatively understanding one’s own or another’s inner functioning [e.g., Harris, 1992], or arrays of innate capabilities that make ‘mindfulness’ possible [e.g., Baron-Cohen, 1995]. In Mead’s approach, the mind and self are in the world as much as they are in individuals. It simply is a matter of perspective, and the taking of perspectives is fi rst and foremost a social activity.\nHowever, Mead’s account also departs in signifi cant ways from neo-Vygotskian accounts of internalization and from what may reasonably be regarded as neo- Meadian accounts by developmentalists like Marková [1987] and Hobson [2002].\nIn many ways, Mead’s perspectival theorizing, when applied to his social, develop- mental account, yields a participation alternative to internalization that demon- strates many of the theoretical advantages that Matusov [1998] previously has pre- sented in arguing for the participation theories of Lave and Wegner [1991] and Ro- goff [1990, 2003]. Not only does Mead’s theorizing seem helpful in overcoming dualisms inherent in internalization accounts, such as individual-social, inner-outer, and mind-action, it also provides a non-reductive account of the ongoing transfor- mation of social and cultural processes through the embedded, situated activity of real human agents. Moreover, it does so with at least somewhat greater precision than the more general descriptions provided by invoking vehicles of induction and transformation such as ‘legitimacy of participation’ and ‘communities of practice’ [Lave & Wenger, 1991, p. 117], as useful as such general terms may be as pointers to the important sociocultural practices to which they refer. Finally, Mead’s strong emphases on position exchange and simultaneity are not found in most neo-Vy- gotskian, participation theories.\nIt is perhaps easiest to evaluate critically Mead’s perspectival realism as a po- tential contribution to contemporary developmental theory by considering it in rela- tion to what may be the most thoroughly Meadian of all contemporary works, Hob- son’s [2002] The Cradle of Thought. The aim of Hobson’s work is to ‘begin with the mental life of babies and to end up with a story of how thinking … emerges in the course of early development’ (p. xiii). Hobson’s account assumes a central role for perspective taking, in that, ‘Thinking becomes possible because the child separates out one person’s perspective from another’s. More than this: thinking arises out of repeated experiences of moving from one psychological stance to another in relation to things and events’ (p. 105). According to Hobson, ‘the mechanism by which all this occurs is the process of identifi cation … To identify with someone is to assume the other person’s stance or characteristics’ (p. 105). To explain how the child be- comes aware of herself and others as beings who have and who can adopt perspec- tives, she fi rst has to take a perspective on herself and her own attitudes. It is only by doing this, by taking a view on her own ways of construing the world, that she can begin to think in terms of her own and others’ perspectives. This happens through a particular species of identifi cation: the child identifi es with others’ attitudes towards the child’s own attitudes and actions (p. 106).\nIn many ways, Hobson’s account is amazingly similar to the perspectival ren- dering of Mead’s developmental thought offered herein. Nonetheless, there are im- portant theoretical disjunctions that may be explored both theoretically and empir- ically in ways that might prove fruitful for contemporary developmental theorizing.\nTo make his thought more concretely accessible, Hobson [2002] employs a model consisting of a triangle of relations in which an infant relates to objects, persons, or events in the world; to herself as the other relates to her; and to the other’s relation to the world [also see Chapman, 1991, 1999]. One of the theoretical purposes to which Hobson puts his relatedness triangle is to explain how the infant becomes able to understand that there is not just one (i.e., her own) but two perspectives (e.g., her own and her mother’s) involved in her interactions with another concerning some aspect of the world (e.g., an object such as a toy). ‘What we need to explain is how the child comes to know that her movement into this position of the other amounts to her taking up a new perspective’ [Hobson, 2002, pp. 108–109]. Hobson’s answer, making use of his relatedness triangle, is to claim that through triangulation, a given object is experienced as in receipt of two different attitudes and meanings, and that ‘it is this that prompts the infant to separate out her own attitude from that of the other’ (p. 109).\nLike Mead, Hobson [2002] emphasizes the importance of simultaneously being in one’s own and another’s perspective in achieving an understanding of mind and self. Hobson also emphasizes the likely importance of taking cooperative, comple- mentary perspectives so that a rudimentary, pre-refl ective understanding of what is involved in sharing may serve as a stepping stone to experiencing connectedness with (when sharing is present), and separation from (when sharing is absent), some- one else [Hobson, 2002, p. 252]. However, where Hobson departs from the perspec- tival theorizing of Mead is by considering the perspective taking involved in the triangulation experiences he describes to be a kind of imitation made possible by a process of identifi cation. ‘There is something about our propensity to imitate others that is as basic as our intellectual prowess … It is the capacity to identify with oth- ers’ [Hobson, 2002, p. 215].\nJust as one person’s expressions of feeling can move someone else to feel things in sympathy, so a person may identify with someone else in the act of imitation. This, too, involves a kind of movement into the other person’s position. The person who imitates assumes something of the mental orientation of the other person. (pp. 221–222) And, just in case there is any doubt about Hobson’s intentions concerning the primacy of processes of imitation and identifi cation with respect to perspective tak- ing, ‘Identifying with people is what leads to perspective taking’ (p. 271).\nOn a Meadian account, Hobson’s [2002] invoking of imitation and identifi ca- tion is both unnecessary and ill-advised. One problem is that neither imitation nor identifi cation, in Hobson’s theorizing and research, are given referential grounds or criteria other than those that defi ne the perspective taking they are supposed to ex- plain. Indeed, there is much in Hobson’s prose to suggest that imitation and identi- fi cation are identical to, or developmental consequences of, perspective taking, rath- er than causal or constitutive antecedents. A second problem is that in positing imi- tation and identifi cation as foundational, Hobson comes dangerously close to re-introducing exactly those aspects of conventional theory of mind and simulation theory that he seems otherwise at pains to dispel with his Wittgensteinian-inspired participation theorizing – ‘in relating to people we get access to minds directly, not via a convoluted route of inferences, deductions and analogies. Minds are neither so hidden nor so abstract as they seem’ [Hobson, 2002, p. 251].\nIn fact, though, it is not a mentalistic theory of mind with which Hobson wish- es to align himself, but Vygotskian internalization, exactly what the presentation of Meadian perspective taking herein is intended to replace (because of its dualism and mystery). According to Hobson, when all is said and done, we should look to Vy- gotsky, for his theory of internalization ‘is a process that may explain what we need to explain: the newly appearing qualities of thinking and the new kinds of self and self-awareness. This is the process of interiorization described by Lev Vygotsky and central to psychoanalytic accounts of development. It is the process by which things that happen between people become things that happen within the individual’s own mind’ [Hobson, 2002, p. 257].\nFor Mead, mind is not an individual property. As stated earlier it is a relation- al entity distributed across and within those coordinated, intersubjective patterns of interaction with others that imbue our worldly actions with meaning. Moreover, there is no need to get behind perspectives. What are most basic are perspectives through which we engage and share in the social process in general, as well as in its particular manifestations in our life histories of interpersonal exchanges within which we emerge as self-conscious, self-interpreting beings. This is not to deny that we eventually come to be able to think in private, to theorize about other minds, or to chart and plan our lives. It is to say that all of these and our other mental and per- sonal activities and capabilities have their ontogenetic sources in social interactivity and participation, not in pre-existing or deeply interiorized mental capabilities and representations which afford us a detached view of the world. Although Hobson [2002] captures many of Mead’s insights concerning perspective taking and offers a potentially useful extension to Mead’s account by emphasizing the centrality of a social- emotional orientation to the development of mind, he seems at times to want to go beneath Mead’s developmental bedrock of social interactivity with others.\nThere can be little doubt that Mead would resist any such excavation.\nSuggested Empirical Research. If Mead’s perspectival social psychology is really to constitute a viable alternative to theories of internalization in contemporary developmental psychology, it should be possible to point to empirical implications and demonstrations and/or assessments of its central claims. First, however, it should be noted that the Meadian conception of perspectives (as action orientations in relation to a larger context or environment) is quite different from the ‘in the head’ conception of perspectives frequently traced to Piaget. Consequently, in addition to extant and possibly future empirical evidence, support for Mead’s perspectivist interpretation of self and mental development necessarily involves appeals to scientifi c criteria such as parsimony, simplicity, and elegance. On such grounds, the preceding critical analysis of Hobson’s [2002] work and ideas is suffi cient to demonstrate that the Meadian account articulated herein makes fewer assumptions and avoids the logical circularity that besets many competitor accounts of the development of mind and self. For example, biological accounts [e.g., the nativism of Meltzoff & Brooks, 2001; the modularity of Baron-Cohen, 1995, 1999; and the evolutionary-ecological approach of Butterworth, 2003] assume many innately seeded internal mechanisms and competencies that Mead does not. More cognitive theories [e.g., the primary and secondary intersubjectivity of Trevarthan, 1993; the intentional insight approach of Tomasello, 1999] are replete with many mentalistic assumptions concerning representation and cognitive architecture that seem to suppose very early refl ective and conceptual abilities that are highly arguable [cf. Carpendale & Lewis, 2004]. Even more socially sensitive theories [e.g., Hobson, 2002; Moore & Corkum, 1994] seem to posit meta-representational capacities [Penner, 1991] and/or very early forms of identifi cation and imitation that are contestable.\nBy comparison, Mead’s perspectival realism gives us a rather straightforward account of the psychological consequences of participation with others in routine gestural and communicative interactions sanctioned within particular sociocultural contexts. It is interactivity within these conventional social practices that enables developing infants and children to experience and occupy a variety of social and personal perspectives, and to use them in both action and imagination. Of course, it may be that Mead’s approach is insuffi ciently replete with distinctions and mecha- nisms required to provide a fully satisfying theory of the development of mind and selfhood. But Mead’s approach offers a comparatively lean account that contains relatively little in the way of contestable assumptions and logical diffi culties. It also fi ts the existing empirical record as well as its competitors. The Meadian approach suggests at least two kinds of research that have not, to date, been popular in the empirical arm of developmental psychology.\nBecause little is assumed in Mead’s theory that is entirely hidden (i.e., all of the developmental mechanisms and events he describes may be quite readily located in sequences of social interaction), intensive longitudinal videotaping of interactions between neonates and their caregivers over the fi rst two years of life would provide a marvelously rich source of data against which to check Mead’s assertions in com- parison with those of other socially oriented theorists like Hobson [2002], as well as more cognitively and/or biologically oriented theorists like Trevarthan [1993]. In particular, it would be important in such studies to construct a number of opera- tional pointers to key processes such as identifi cation, imitation, intersubjectivity, and perspective taking (especially multiple perspective taking, in terms of role rever- sals, combinations, and coordinations) that might be used to adjudicate amongst competing accounts of key developmental accomplishments and processes.\nFor example, indications of perspective taking in intersubjective interactional sequences could be indicated by role reversals in which a caregiver and year-old child occupy different perspectives in simple, repeated actions – a child holds out a piece of food to a mother who takes a bite and then offers the food to the child by moving it toward the child’s mouth while simultaneously pointing with her other hand to the child’s mouth. Completion of such a simple sequence of role reversal and intersub- jective perspective taking might be indicated by the child taking a bite of the food and then offering it once again to the mother. Children’s play with dolls and other toys also may be observed for instances of positional exchange and simultaneity. If such instances could be interpreted reasonably as re-enactments of previously expe- rienced exchanges with caregivers, they would support Mead’s theoretical position.\nIn general, if perspective taking is developmentally foundational in the manner pro- posed by Mead, the child’s occupation and simultaneous coordination of roles and phases in diverse social interactions ought to be affected by the ways in which care- givers coordinate the child’s perspective with their own. This being so, it would be especially interesting to note possible differences in the quantity and quality of chil- dren’s perspective taking that might be related to their interactions with those pri- mary caregivers with whom they are most active socially.\nOf course, to some extent, it remains a matter of interpretation as to whether to treat particular aspects of events like food sharing or doll play as instances of par- ticipatory role and perspective taking or identifi cation and imitation. However, it also might be possible to train caregivers (or research assistants acting as caregivers) to take advantage of naturally occurring events of this kind, and follow them with quasi-scripted actions that are less immediately interactive in order to determine what responses, if any, the child might make to them. For example, following the food-sharing scenario just described, the caregiver or research assistant might move away from the child and begin engaging in a novel form of activity without looking at the child, or otherwise directing her movements to the child. If children consis- tently imitate the actions of others under these less interactive conditions, Mead’s thesis concerning the necessity of relational interactivity for perspective taking would be unsupported empirically. Obviously, a great deal remains to be worked out in any such potential program of research. However, it is clear that such work would need to be conceived in considerable theoretical detail, would be methodologically very challenging, and would demand a great commitment of time and energy from both participating families and researchers.\nA second kind of research that might be especially instructive with respect to examining empirically some of Mead’s central theoretical propositions could in- volve experimental or quasi-experimental interventions with young children in day- care centers. Mead has been interpreted [both herein and by Gillespie, 2005] as maintaining that cooperative interactions may be especially powerful bases for the development and taking of complementary perspectives, which very likely are the fi rst kinds of perspectives to be held simultaneously. This being so, structured ac- tivities involving role-play or games within which young children (both immediate- ly prior to and following the beginnings of language use) might be encouraged and helped to experience complementary phases or roles in structured communicative, action sequences could be arranged. The consequences of such interactivity then might be examined on subsequent tasks in which participating children are asked to demonstrate their perspective taking capability and self-understanding. By compar- ing such demonstrations to those of similar children who have not participated in the ‘complementary perspective’ interventions, it might be possible to gauge some- thing of the likely effects of such experiences.\nOf course, any such interventions would need to be of a reasonably lengthy du- ration, and the studies themselves would benefi t greatly from intensive, longitudinal recording and analysis of a carefully planned set of gradually more demanding and sophisticated forms of perspective sharing and multiple perspective taking over the course of the interventions. It might also prove instructive in such studies to contrast Meadian and Vygotskian forms of facilitative intervention. In the former, young children might be encouraged to participate in and reverse their participation across complementary roles within different phases of interactivity. In the latter, young children might be encouraged to expand and increase their perspective taking capa- bilities by building on the instructional scaffolding provided by more developmen- tally advanced others (perhaps including modeling that emphasizes identifi cation with, and imitation of, researcher-teachers and/or older children).\nThe simultaneous occupation and reactive consideration of non-complemen- tary, even antagonistic, perspectives may be viewed as demanding greater accumu- lated experience of perspective taking and multiple perspectival involvement. It is an empirical question as to whether these more oppositional forms of perspective taking really can develop out of initially complementary perspective taking as Mead suggests. Certainly there are several extant theoretical perspectives [e.g., Bakhtin, 1986; Billig, 1987; Hermans, 2002; Wertsch, 1991] that might contest such a devel- opmental sequence as too facile.\nPerspective Taking and Agency It is by means of perspectives, which are experientially occupied and available actually and imaginatively as situated resources for action, that individuals become Meadian ‘Mes.’ However, agency goes beyond the ‘Me’ in that it manifests as a reac- tion to the ‘Me,’ one which may become increasingly self-interpretive with repeated and differentiated experiences, especially in problem-solving situations. Of course, this Meadian ‘I’ need not be self-consciously or even consciously engaged. In many ways, Mead seems to suggest that a basic pre-refl ective, reactive agency is part of what it is to be a human being participating in social processes with other human beings. In this sense, one is an agent by acting and reacting to extant perspectives available in social situations. However, there is little doubt that Mead also is com- mitted to a rather strong program of self-refl ective rational and moral agency, espe- cially during adulthood: There are no absolute values. There are only values which, on account of incomplete social organization, we cannot as yet estimate, and in face of these the fi rst enterprise should be to complete the organization if only in thought so that some rough sort of estimate in terms of the other values involved becomes conceivable. [Mead in Reck, 1964, p. 262] As a functional reaction to perspectives and situations, our agency is constantly emergent within those concerns and problems that we encounter in our sociocul- tural and biophysical world. Mead understood agency as a situated reaction to extant perspectives that goes beyond them in the act of reacting to them. His account of agency thus resists the classic dualism of free will versus determinism.\nPossible Theoretical Progress At least a few contemporary developmental theorists have formulated theories of emergent agency that may be related to aspects of Mead’s thought. For example, Bidell and Fischer [1997] have presented an epigenetic account that treats our ge- netic make-up and sociocultural context and participation as active self-organizing systems that, together with persons as self-organizing systems, jointly determine our intellectual and agentic development. However, unlike Mead, Bidell and Fischer understand the human agent not as multiply situated, reactive, and functionally ori- ented to the future resolution of problems, but as actively creative in the construc- tion, within a process of hierarchical integration, of new concepts and skills. Despite their declarations of systems-wide epigenesis, Bidell and Fischer, like many contem- porary developmentalists, adopt a highly cognitive, representational, and operation- al framework that locks the developing agent inside her own cerebral mechanisms in interaction with her environment and genetic make-up, rather than viewing her as creatively participating in social processes and interpersonal interactions in ways that transform both her society and her self.\nA more Meadian outlook may be found in the work of Mark Bickhard [1999, 2004]. To Bickhard [2004], ‘An infant is a socially tuned biological creature with marvelous capacity for development into a participant in, and co-creator of, social realities’ (p. 125). For Bickhard, social realities take the form of situational and in- stitutional conventions. Some of these conventions hold across multiple times and people. Some must constantly be worked out in an ongoing process of interpersonal interactivity. Conventionalization consists in large part of common understandings and practices that contain distinctive roles and functions. Participation in social conventions constitutes the world of the individual in a deeply normative sense.\nNormativities themselves ‘are emergent from, ontologically involved in, and func- tion as constraints – and enabling constraints – upon individual level values and actions’ (p. 119). For Bickhard [2004], ontogenetic development is the story of the emergence of an entirely new kind of being, one who participates in society and culture and history. And the person, in so participating, participates in the emergent creation of society in turn … The person is constituted in the multiple ways of being social that that individual has de- veloped in that society and culture and historical time. (pp 125–126) Bickhard’s work follows the general pragmatist approach taken by Mead [1934], especially with respect to emphasizing the naturalness of the functional relations he assumes between persons and their environments. ‘Interactive representation … emerges with complete naturalism out of certain sorts of functional organizations’ [Bickhard, 1999, p. 450]. Note that this is not the kind of cognitive representation thought to consist of encodings of external objects and events. What is represented is not objects, things, or entities in the world, but possibilities for acting. Such ‘func- tions’ are always emerging, and differentiate the environment in ways that open up interactive possibilities. With respect to persons and their societies, Bickhard under- stands both as constantly emergent and co-constitutive. The sociocultural environ- ment is constitutive of personhood in two senses: constructive and interactive. Constructively, learning to engage in the simpler social interactions of childhood provides the scaffolded resources for the eventual construc- tion of the adult social person. Interactively, the person is being social insofar as he or she is interacting with or within those social realities. … Personhood, in being a socially con- stituted constructive emergent, is itself a social and historical ontology. [Bickhard, 1992, p. 86] For Bickhard, the person is a socially spawned agent capable of contributing to her participation in those interactions and social processes in which she exists. Her previous social experiences have provided her with a set of functions she can use to think and act in relation to current and future contexts. This is a very Meadian un- derstanding of agency, yet one which still does not make full use of the theoretical resources that Mead’s perspectivism has to offer.\nTo date, no contemporary developmental psychologist, or any other contempo- rary psychologist for that matter, has theorized agency in a manner specifi cally con- sistent with Mead’s perspectivism – as a constantly emergent reactivity to those multiple perspectives within which the socially involved and constituted person is situated and active. As already noted, in early development, such an agency is most- ly pre-conceptual and non-deliberatively reactive. However, with greater experience in conventional social processes and interactions, the developing human agent is increasingly able to take and work within a multiplicity of perspectives. Such multi- perspectival experience enables a much more refl ective, deliberative agency that may be targeted at specifi c problems and concerns [Martin, Sugarman, & Thompson, 2003].\nSuggested Empirical Research To indicate ways in which a more truly Meadian conception of agency might be infused into research in developmental psychology, it is possible to extend the two lines of research suggested and developed earlier when considering research on ‘in- ternalization.’ For example, the kind of naturalistic, longitudinal study outlined above might explore opportunities for children to apply their nascent ability to oc- cupy two complimentary perspectives to novel situations. For instance, a third indi- vidual (another research assistant) might enter the room and point at what remains of the food that had been offered and received by mother and child in the earlier example, and then point to her own mouth. The ability of young children with dif- fering experiences of complimentary perspectival exchange and coordination to re- spond agentically in such relatively unfamiliar interpersonal contexts would speak directly to the developmental links between perspective taking and personal agency posited by Mead. With older children who have some use of language and greater familiarity with simple picture books, toy models, and audiovisual media, more ad- vanced forms of perspective taking might be examined. To this end, researchers might consider assisting caregivers and research assistants to sprinkle their ongoing interactions with their young charges with a diverse range of perspective taking ac- tivities. Useful ideas for such activities are readily available in the various scenarios that frequently have been used by developmental psychologists who have studied role and perspective taking over the years [e.g., Light, 1979]. Of course, a careful, longitudinal recording of instances of perspectival exchange, coordination, and ap- plication to novel circumstances would speak directly to Mead’s perspectival theo- rizing with or without such planned, quasi-scripted extensions to ongoing, naturally occurring interactions between adults and children. Nonetheless, the deployment of such extensions would certainly increase the amount and variety of interaction di- rectly relevant to perspective taking in Mead’s terms.\nThe second kind of research suggested earlier consisted of experimental or quasi-experimental interventions in which cooperative interactions that encour- aged the simultaneous occupation of complementary perspectives were facilitated in an attempt to expedite the perspective taking and self-understanding of young children. Such studies also could examine relationships between participation in interventions that encourage the occupation of multiple perspectives and the agen- tic reactivity of children to these perspectives. Once again, creative variations on a variety of extant role- and perspective-taking tasks and demonstrations might be employed to examine direct and vicarious indications of agentic capability that, ac- cording to Mead, might be expected to emerge from experiences of multiple per- spectivity. Actions potentially indicative of agency might be theorized and coded within situations and tasks that are purposefully constructed to contain novel and/ or problem elements not found in the contexts and tasks employed in the interven- tions per se. Many childhood games (e.g., hide-and-seek, I spy, and clue) are condu- cive to perspectival exchange, simultaneity, and coordination, and can be tailored by researchers to enhance further the various kinds of persepctivity encouraged and to introduce novel elements into routine sequences of game activity. Diffi cult con- ceptual and theoretical issues concerning what constitutes suffi cient similarity and difference to warrant ascriptions of agency to children’s interactive and situational actions would obviously pose signifi cant challenges in such research. However, there is no reason to suspect that these would, at least in principle, prove any more diffi cult than the host of conceptual, defi nitional, and theoretical matters that at- tend extant research on perspective taking [see Chandler, 2001; Menna & Cohen, 1997; Schober, 1998].\nConclusion In an autobiographical refl ection on his then 35 years as a developmental psy- chologist studying perspective taking, John Flavell [1992], whose neo-Piagetian ac- count stands as one of the major theoretical positions in this area of theory and re- search, states that: My coworkers and I get the impression when testing young 3-year-olds that most of them are simply not ‘maturationally ready’ to understand our questions about mental representa- tions, and that the best we can do is just wait for them to grow a little older. … There is just not enough there yet on which to build. (p. 133) But, if, as Flavell goes on to say, ‘young children do not know that they and other people have conceptual, perceptual, and affective perspectives … [and] they do not know that people mentally represent the world’ (pp. 133–134), why do so many developmental psychologists insist on describing perspective taking in terms of simulation theories and theories of mind? Such theories assume that young infants understand other persons as animate agents, and so share emotions and en- gage with them dyadically; 9-months-olds understand other persons as goal-directed agents and so share goals (and perception) and engage them triadically; and 14-month-olds under- stand other persons as intentional agents and so share intentions (and attention) and engage with them collaboratively (so creating, via internalization, dialogic cognitive representa- tions). [Tomasello, Carpenter, Call, Behne, & Moll, in press] What Mead’s perspectivism, as applied to his social, developmental account of children’s perspective taking, reveals is that a viable theoretical option is to treat activity with others as a source of orientations toward action within routine situa- tions (i.e., as perspectives) that may be shared and occupied in pre-refl ective ways, thus creating important developmental bases for mind, self, and later forms of un- derstanding that are more clearly representational. For Mead, theories of develop- ment that assume that infants and very young children identify with, and imitate, others as consciously self-refl ective agents with unique mental perspectives and rep- resentations assume exactly what developmental theories should set out to explain.\nOur obviously important abilities to act refl ectively, intentionally, and self-con- sciously grow out of our activity with others and the early forms of perspective taking that such interactivity enables. They should not be invoked to make sense of the early intersubjectivity on which they depend. Mead consistently gave developmental primacy to social interactivity as a basis for higher forms of consciousness and cog- nition.\nIt is, of course, true that Mead’s defi nitions and conceptions of early perspective taking do not distinguish between perceptual and conceptual perspective taking [Chandler, 2001] or among a speaker’s situation and identity, conceptualizations, conversational agenda, and knowledge [Schober, 1998]. Without in any way denying that such distinctions may be both important and necessary for particular theoreti- cal and practical purposes, it nonetheless remains doubtful that they are needed to make plausible sense of perspective taking in early childhood. For Mead, perspective taking is a basic fact of sociality, which he understands as being in two or more per- spectives simultaneously. This form of perspective taking is not predominately men- talistic. It is relational and positional. It constitutes the very social reality in which we are embedded from birth, and through our ontogenetic experience it comes to constitute us as socially formed agents whose multiperspectival reactivity is a defi n- ing feature of the human condition and the ongoing self-societal dialectic. In many ways, more interactionist and participatory theories of early childhood development such as those of Bickhard [1999, 2004], Hobson [2002], and Rogoff [2003] begin to approach at least some of the Meadian ideas articulated herein, especially with re- spect to social, interpersonal processes related to ‘internalization’ and agency. How- ever, even here, the constitutive processes most central to Mead’s theorizing, multi- perspectival occupation and reactivity, have not to date received the attention they deserve.\nPerhaps, contemporary developmentalists have been overly infl uenced by the somewhat dismissive reception that Mead has been accorded by leading scholars like John Flavell. Flavell praises Mead for making ‘it diffi cult for all subsequent theorists, both to ignore the importance of communication processes in human development, and to ignore the importance of role taking in communicative processes’ [Flavell, Botkin, Fry, Wright, & Jarvis, 1968, pp. 15–16]. However, he goes on to criticize Mead for an alleged inability to explain the fi ner details of perspective taking – ‘he does not [explain] how A acquires the ability to discern B’s qualities as a responder generally, and in particular how he acquires the ability to select those gestures which will, in fact, arouse the same response in B’ [Flavell et al., 1968, pp. 15–16]. Hope- fully, one consequence of the interpretation of Mead’s theory of perspective taking offered herein (especially the joint processes of being within different perspectives simultaneously and responding agentively to them) will be to challenge such assess- ments of Mead’s actual and potential contribution to developmental thought, theo- ry, and research. Of course, any such reassessment of Mead’s contribution must await further theoretical and empirical inquiry into his detailed hypotheses concern- ing the social development of mind and self. At this writing, it is by no means clear that Mead’s theory of perspective taking is suffi cient as a developmental account of our ascendance to self-conscious experience during ontogenesis, or that it is capable of dealing with the challenges posed by perspectives that may be much more dra- matically oppositional than those available in the vast majority of his discussions and examples. However, it quite obviously is a more developed, specifi c, and de- tailed account than that assumed in much of the developmental literature that has referred to Mead’s ideas [e.g. Davidson & Youniss, 1995; Flavell et al., 1968].\nTo date, only a very few studies exist that have investigated Mead’s views em- pirically and theoretically in comparison with those of infl uential developmental theorists like Piaget and Vygotsky. One of these was concerned with the relationship between private speech and a child’s awareness of the meanings of actions [Kohl- berg, Yaeger, & Hjertholm, 1968]. Another [Light, 1979] dealt specifi cally with role taking in a manner that lends itself readily to Mead’s theorizing about perspectives and perspective taking as developed herein. The authors of both of these studies speculated that Piaget’s conception of egocentrism could potentially be tied to Mead’s emphasis on perspective taking in a highly complementary manner. Light [1979], in particular, suggests that where Piaget equated the problem of centering on a particular social perspective with that of cen- tering on a particular aspect of a situation … Mead [makes] the same equation, and [argues] that social decentration is a necessary condition for intellectual decentration. (p. 12) However, for Mead, perspective taking serves both epistemological and onto- logical functions during ontogenesis. It is not only our knowing, but more fundamen- tally our being or existence as psychological selves and agents that is at stake. It is only by occupying and reacting to perspectives available in the social reality in which we are active that we become psychological beings for whom understanding is a con- cern.",

S. Kuhn, science is a collective activity of solving still unsolved puzzles recognized in a specialized domain of research, and this activity is guided by one or more exemplary instances of concrete problem solving. Today, we have more and more cases of scientific research in which AIs are utilized as essential tools. Though the AI agents do not have subjective motivation to solve the puzzle, they will emerge as powerful actors that solve some of the puzzles in a Kuhnian way, or at least help (human-) scientists do it. This would imply that the concepts of science, scientists, and scientific research will change. Will the advancement of AI induce us to redefine science? I will discuss this question from a couple of perspectives.\nInvited Talk 2\nPredictively-valid “Alien” Features, or Artifacts? Coping with Inscrutable Scientific Progress\nCameron Buckner (University of Florida)\nSystems like AlphaFold raise the prospect of predictive AI systems that can blow past previous upper bounds on the performance of hand-designed analytical models in many areas of scientific analysis. It is difficult to disagree with the results of these systems, which can achieve predictive accuracy on problems that were thought to be too complex or chaotic for human scientific theory to solve. However, these models may base their predictions on features that are in some sense beyond the cognitive grasp of humans–“alien” properties that may have predictive utility but which are not natural or cognitively accessible to us. In this talk I will analyze these properties by beginning with a discussion of adversarial attacks, and discuss methods for coping with this epistemic situation in a scientific regime which increasingly relies on complex deep learning models for data analysis.\nInvited Talk 3\nIsolationism for Holists\nAndre Curtis-Trudel (University of Cincinnati)\nEmily Sullivan (Utrecht University)\nModels often idealize their target phenomenon; but when are idealizations successful and how might we evaluate idealizations? Holists argue that justifying and evaluating models and their idealizations must proceed holistically and cannot be a function of aggregating or assessing individual parts of models. The holist argument comes from different pressure points. For some highly complex models it seems practically unfeasible to isolate where model failures occur due to opacity and complexity in interactions between different parts of the model. In other cases, it seems that isolationism suffers from a more fundamental problem: idealizations cannot be removed or isolated without radically changing the character of the model itself. In this talk, we look at the example of AlphaFold, a highly complex model in machine learning. AlphaFold is a paradigmatic example of the kind of highly complex model well suited for the holist project. However, we argue that decomposition and isolationism are necessary (and indeed possible) for evaluating the AlphaFold’s idealizations and the way they contribute to its success. As a result, we argue that holists should endorse the isolationist project.\nInvited Talk 4\nAI and the Logic of Scientific Discovery\nYeongseo Yeo (Dongduk Women’s University)\nIs deep learning AI reliable? AlphaFold2, a deep learning AI renowned for its accurate protein structure predictions, won the 2024 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Its empirical success is undeniably impressive. However, many philosophers remain concerned about its epistemic opacity. Like other deep learning models, AlphaFold2 operates as a “black box,” meaning that its internal decision-making processes are not entirely interpretable. This lack of transparency raises fundamental questions: When should we rely on deep learning AI, and when not? What conditions must deep learning AI meet to be considered reliable? Can scientific knowledge be derived solely from deep learning AI? Philosophers have extensively debated these concerns, and with the groundbreaking success of AlphaFold2 and AlphaFold3, it is time to raise a new question: Can their empirical achievements challenge the skeptical or pessimistic views of philosophers on AlphaFold and deep learning AI?\nDuede (2023) suggests that deep learning AI may be valuable in the context of discovery, where it generates plausible hypotheses, but not in the context of justification, where scientific claims require rigorous testing and confirmation. But is this old distinction the only way to defend deep learning AI? Should we conclude that an epistemically opaque system like AlphaFold2 is ultimately unreliable?\nOrtmann (2025) challenges this skepticism by distinguishing between why-reliability and whether-reliability. He argues that even if we do not fully understand why AlphaFold2 is reliable, we can still determine whether it is reliable or not. The whether-reliability of alphaFold2 has already been demonstrated through its empirical success. Furthermore, its widespread adoption in contemporary scientific research provides additional support for its whether-reliability. After all, an unreliable tool would not be so extensively used in scientific practice.\nYet, many skeptical philosophers would remain unconvinced. For example, Duede (2022) insists that brute inductive considerations are never enough, that is, transparency is essential for true reliability. Similarly, Mitchell (2020) argues that empirical success must be accompanied by epistemic warrant, since reliability arises from the combination of theory’s epistemic warrant and the stability of supporting evidence.\nThis presentation explores, in response to Duede and Mitchell, whether the Logic of Discovery, understood as a set of problem-solving heuristics, can provide the necessary epistemic warrant for AlphaFold and deep learning AI. The idea is that the methods and principles underlying AlphaFold’s development may serve as a foundation for establishing its why-reliability. By articulating the heuristics that guided the creation of AlphaFold, we may be able to offer sufficient epistemic warrant to address concerns about the transparency required for AlphaFold and deep learning AI.\nInvited Talk 5\nOn Finding What You’re (not) Looking for: Prospects and Challenges for AI-driven Discovery\nAndre Curtis-Trudel (University of Cincinnati)\nRecent high-profile scientific achievements by machine learning (ML) and especially deep learning (DL) systems have reinvigorated interest in ML for automated scientific discovery (e.g., Wang et al. 2023). Much of this work is motivated by the thought that DL methods might facilitate the efficient discovery of phenomena, hypotheses, or even models or theories more efficiently than traditional, theory-driven approaches to discovery. This talk considers some of the more specific obstacles to automated, DL-driven discovery in frontier science, focusing on gravitational-wave astrophysics (GWA) as a representative case study. In the first part of the talk, we argue that despite these efforts prospects for DL-driven discovery in GWA remain uncertain. In the second part, we advocate a shift in focus towards the ways DL can be used to augment or enhance existing discovery methods, and the epistemic virtues and vices associated with these uses. We argue that the primary epistemic virtue of many such uses is to decrease opportunity costs associated with investigating puzzling or anomalous signals, and that the right framework for evaluating these uses comes from philosophical work on pursuitworthiness.\nInvited Talk 6\nThe Moral Importance of Explainable AI\nKate Vredenburgh (London School of Economics and Political Science)\nUnderstanding AI systems is important not just epistemically, but also morally. In this talk, I will do three things. First, I will argue an account of the moral values that are important for two different types of AI systems, what we might call predictive machines versus agents. I argue that enabling individuals to engage in informed self-advocacy is important for predictive machines, whereas values like trust and interpersonal respect are important for agents. The type of AI system thus has implications for what kind of explanations we should aim at, and corresponding scientific paradigms in XAI. Second, for predictive machines, I will use the example of credit scoring to argue that we face a fundamental tension between explaining how to be someone who has some property P and how to be judged to be someone who has some property P. Because of static modeling choices, and uncertainty, the two come apart. While the latter is attractive from a mathematical perspective, it requires background institutions that lessen the cost of mistakes to individuals. The former, however, may not suitably enable informed self-advocacy. Third, I will argue that interpersonal justification is important for agents, even artificial agents, but that providing justifications requires a responsiveness to reasons and social norms that artificial agents lack.\nInvited Talk 7\nFoundation Models in Healthcare Require Rethinking Reliability\nThomas Grote (University of Tübingen)\nA new class of AI models, called foundation models, has entered healthcare. Foundation models violate several basic principles of the standard machine learning paradigm for assessing reliability – they are tested with data they might have seen during training, trained with data from different and oftentimes opaque sources, and generate outputs whose adequacy for purpose is difficult to assess. These violations make it necessary to rethink what guarantees we require to establish warranted trust into foundation models.\nContributed Talks 1\nBeyond Tools: How Working with Coding AI Reshapes Cognition, Agency, and Subjectivity\nYubeen Kwon (Seoul National University)\nWhat does it mean to work alongside AI? What changes are required to collaborate effectively? How does collaborating with AI reshape our understanding of cognition, agency, and subjectivity?\nAI is distinguished from previous technologies in its ability to perform functions traditionally associated with human cognition, such as learning, problem-solving, and autonomous decision-making. Since the release of OpenAI’s ChatGPT, workplaces across various sectors have explored ways to integrate generative AI, sparking critical questions about its effective use in workflows and the management of human-AI teams.\nIn the software development community, coding AI tools such as GitHub Copilot have rapidly gained traction, becoming integral to developers’ practices. This presentation draws on in-depth interviews with 30 developers who routinely use coding AI—including GitHub Copilot, Code Whisperer, Claude, and ChatGPT—as well as observational research on their workflows. The developers formed relationships with AI that go beyond just using it as a tool – they treat it as an assistant, partner, and sometimes even as an extension of themselves. Notably, developers actively “teach” AI their intentions and goals, gradually shaping them into their ‘digital doppelgängers’ through iterative interactions and feedback. This shows how developers aren’t just delegating tasks to AI – they’re sharing their thinking processes with it.\nUsing cognitive and human-machine interface frameworks, this presentation explores the dynamic unfolding of agency in human-AI collaboration, emphasizing the roles of both human and non-human agencies. Frameworks such as distributed cognition and cognitive assemblage illuminate how cognitive processes are redistributed and reconfigured in these interactions. Developers increasingly view AI not merely as a tool but as an extension of their own cognitive processes, resulting in what can be termed a cognitive assemblage. Through analysis of the interactions between human developer and coding AI, this presentation demonstrates the necessity of an expanded concept of subjectivity that reflects the complex entanglements of cognition and agency in everyday interactions with AI.\nDistributed and Probabilistic Model of Representation\nLee-Sun Choi (Ewha Womans University)\nHow is the representation of the world constructed? Roughly speaking, a representation system receives data from external sources, encodes it through its input system, and combines this encoded information in the internal system to deliver and maintain it in working memory. Our world representation is not solely composed of information about individual entities, such as Garfield, Tom, or Cheshire, but also includes representations of categories, such as cats. These categories are called concepts. We represent the world using concepts.\nResearch on representational systems in artificial intelligence can be broadly divided into two processes. The first is the process of concept application, which explains how newly provided information is categorized within an existing conceptual framework. The second is the process of concept formation, which describes how new concepts are created based on data. This study focuses on the latter process, discussing how world representation is determined through concept formation.\nThis study proposes a new representational theory that integrates two major theories in artificial intelligence and cognitive science: distributed representation and probabilistic representation. Distributed representation, a core theory in deep learning, particularly in natural language processing and computer vision, places data in a feature space composed of multiple dimensions. For example, an image of a cat is represented by extracting low-level features such as contours, edges, colors, and textures, which are then combined into more complex features like “having ears” or “having a tail.” This feature space can be seen as a high-dimensional coordinate system, where each feature serves as an axis, and the input data is represented as a single point, or vector, in this space. A point can be understood as a combination of various features.\nProbabilistic representation models, on the other hand, interpret the process of concept formation as analyzing clusters of data in the feature space using specific likelihood functions. Dense data clusters, especially those isolated from other clusters, are more likely to be individuated as single concepts. In contrast, sparse clusters or patterns with multiple clusters are more likely to be interpreted as multiple concepts. This model opens the possibility for various observers to construct equivalent world representations based on the same data, assuming that no privileged world representation, such as a “God’s view,” exists. This aligns with the characteristics of human representation and also sets the conditions for the emergence of new concepts.\nHowever, if different world representation models exist, they must be translatable into one another; otherwise, each model risks being solipsistically isolated. This study proposes a method to evaluate the agreement of concepts in different feature spaces using quantitative metrics based on Kullback-Leibler divergence, assessing the consistency and differences between concepts.\nNevertheless, integrating distributed and probabilistic representations entails several limitations. For instance, the composition of the feature space—what features and how many of them are included—can lead to entirely different clusters for the same external input data. This discrepancy makes translating concept-based clusters across models challenging and highlights the constraints of assuming that all world representation models share the same dimensional structure of the feature space. This study explores the implications of these limitations for designing representation models and investigates the possibilities and boundaries of an integrated representational theory.\nContributed Talks 2\nArtificial Possibilities\nBojana Grujičić (Max Planck School of Cognition)\nScience often deals with issues pertaining to possibilities, contingencies and necessities, by engaging in thought experiments and modeling. This talk discusses how much modal scientific understanding can be obtained by the use of deep neural networks in cognitive science. One epistemically useful feature of neural networks is their runnability – they can be trained to perform a cognitive task and can run when given novel stimuli, demonstrating possibilities of cognitive phenomena based on sets of inductive biases. I focus on the problem of justification of neural network-based inferences about possibilities and outline a plausible justificatory strategy. I consider a number of reasons for taking neural network-demonstrated possibilities to be technological, rather than biological possibilities. Despite this, I argue that they add to our modal scientific understanding of cognitive phenomena.\nAugmented Intellect: AI as Extended Mind in Scientific Understanding\nInjin Woo (Sungkyunkwan University)\nIn this paper, I argue that Artificial Intelligence (AI) advances scientific understanding through the mechanism of (socially) extended cognition. Many researchers speculate that AI, upon reaching AGI, may satisfy certain conditions for agency, such as intentionality and autonomy. By examining the conceptual framework of extended cognition and integrating perspectives from Pritchard and Khalifa’s epistemologies, I demonstrate how AI transcends traditional tool-based cognition to become an active participant in scientific understanding.\nAI can be considered extended cognition, as defined by Chalmers and Clark (1998). Extended cognition involves integrating human cognitive processes with external environments or tools. Three essential conditions must be met: reliable coupling, direct availability, and automatic endorsement. AI is deeply integrated into human life, operating consistently and dependably (e.g., AI assistants). It responds instantly to questions or commands, supporting human cognitive demands in real time. AI systems earn user trust through repeated use and positive experiences. Just as smartphones have demonstrated their potential to function as extended cognition—despite initial technical limitations—AI also holds the potential to constitute extended cognition (Helliwell, 2019).\nBuilding upon the concept of extended cognition, we now turn to the idea of socially extended cognition. Pritchard (2022) explains scientific knowledge by emphasizing how collaboration contributes to understanding. Socially extended cognition occurs when the information-processing activities of others are integrated into an individual’s cognitive process, leading to knowledge beyond individual capability. If AI possesses agency, it can function as part of our socially extended cognition. AI supports and complements cognitive processes through collaboration with humans, unlike human collaboration, which may lack direct availability. AI minimizes or eliminates these limitations, reinforcing its role as a form of socially extended cognition. Pritchard limited his discussion to scientific knowledge, but I aim to integrate it with research on scientific understanding.\nTo grasp how this socially extended cognition enhances not just scientific knowledge, but also scientific understanding, we turn to Khalifa’s EKS model. Khalifa emphasizes that knowledge, particularly explanatory knowledge acquired through scientific explanatory evaluation (SEEing), is at the heart of understanding. SEEing in the EKS Model is a process of considering and comparing a range of plausible potential explanations, then selecting the most compelling one based on evidence and other explanatory considerations. This process of scientific inquiry goes beyond mere belief, leading to well-justified, reliable understanding that minimizes accidental or coincidental elements. Consequently, AI plays a pivotal role in enhancing SEEing, whether as a tool or as a collaborative partner.\nBuilding on this discussion, a critical review of scientists’ research (Krenn et al., 2022) on how AI contributes to scientific understanding highlights three key dimensions: (1) computational microscope, (2) resource of inspiration, and (3) agent of understanding. As a data processing and evaluation tool, AI enhances researchers’ ability to compare potential explanations and identify the most compelling ones. As a collaborator, AI generates hypotheses, refines frameworks, and enhances human cognition, thereby strengthening scientific evaluation. Through these dual roles, AI transforms the processes of SEEing, ultimately contributing to enhanced scientific understanding.\nAutonomous Weapon Systems and Just War Theory: A Critical Reevaluation ofJus in BelloPrinciple\nSangsu Kim (Korea Military Academy)\nThe emergence of Autonomous Weapon Systems (AWS), driven by the revolutionary advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), has fundamentally transformed modern warfare, calling for a critical reevaluation of the jus in bello principles within the framework of Just War Theory (JWT). AWS, as a product of AI innovation, operate independently, making critical decisions without human intervention, thereby enhancing operational efficiency. However, their autonomy raises serious ethical concerns about their ability to adhere to the core principles of discrimination and proportionality under JWT. These concerns are particularly significant given that AWS are weapon systems involving decisions that directly impact human lives, underscoring the urgent need for robust ethical frameworks to govern their use.\nJus in bello is a set of ethical principles that govern the conduct of war, requiring all moral agents involved in warfare to uphold its standards. Widely accepted as a foundational moral guideline in international contexts, these principles serve as the minimum ethical framework for ensuring the dignity and rights of individuals, even in the unavoidable circumstances of war. In particular, discrimination and proportionality are key to maintaining the moral legitimacy of warfare by protecting innocent civilians and ensuring that the use of force remains strictly aligned with legitimate military objectives.\nThe principle of discrimination requires a clear distinction between combatants and non-combatants, safeguarding civilians and other protected entities from unnecessary harm. This principle assumes that decision-makers can assess complex battlefield scenarios and make judgments consistent with international humanitarian law. Nonetheless, AWS, relying on preprogrammed algorithms and datasets, face significant challenges in identifying non-combatants accurately in dynamic and unpredictable environments. When incomplete or biased datasets influence AWS decision-making, there is a heightened risk of serious violations of the principle of discrimination.\nThe principle of proportionality demands that the harm caused by military actions be balanced against the anticipated military advantage. This principle requires nuanced assessments that go beyond mere calculations, incorporating moral and contextual factors. Yet, AWS operate based on predefined parameters, potentially failing to account for the complexity of real-world situations. The possibility of unforeseen outcomes further calls into question whether AWS can consistently uphold the proportionality principle in practice.\nThis presentation critically examines whether AWS can effectively adhere to the principles of discrimination and proportionality. It evaluates the technical and ethical capabilities of AWS to distinguish between combatants and non-combatants, avoid unlawful targets, and make decisions that align with human moral standards. Furthermore, it explores whether the use of lethal force by AWS can be justified under the principle of proportionality and discusses the extent to which human oversight is necessary to ensure compliance with these ethical principles.\nThe presentation is structured around three key discussions. First, it analyzes the technical characteristics and operational roles of AWS to assess whether they align with the established principles of JWT. Second, it reevaluates the ethical and practical interpretations of discrimination and proportionality to determine their applicability to AWS. Third, it proposes alternative approaches to reconfiguring jus in bello principles to reflect the ethical challenges posed by advanced technologies like AWS in modern warfare.\nUltimately, this presentation highlights the ethical urgency of scrutinizing AWS, given their origins in AI innovation and their life-and-death implications. It seeks to provide a framework for assessing AWS within the ethical boundaries of jus in bello, aiming to balance technological innovation with moral accountability. This approach contributes to redefining the ethical standards of modern warfare while ensuring justice and humanity remain central in the context of evolving conflicts.\nContributed Talks 3\nPrediction, Projection, and Performativity\nKonstantin Genin (University of Tübingen)\nIt is widely recognized that in social contexts predictions are not mere causally inert prognostications about future outcomes, but have a causal impact on the outcomes that they intend to predict. This is especially the case when predictions directly inform policy decisions. When predictions can be self-fulfilling, or self-undermining, pragmatic and epistemic considerations are entangled, and the notion of accuracy becomes ambiguous. Moreover, the notion of inductive risk must be revisited: values do not only come into play because the consequences of different kinds of error must be weighed, but also because we worry that predictions might be right for the wrong reasons. Many proposals have been made on how to deal with performativity, including “endogenizing” performative effects, or making predictions that steer outcomes in socially desirable directions. We argue that these approaches are misguided. Many undesirable performative effects arise because the outputs of machine learning models are ambiguous between predictions that predict outcomes by implicitly guessing which policy will be adopted, and counterfactual projections that predict outcomes were some policy option selected. Once we make the right distinction between prediction and projections, pragmatic and epistemic issues can be cleanly distinguished. We argue that only by aiming at accurate projections can machine learning models be not only decision-supportive but discourse-supportive: furnishing the relevant projections to allow discussants with a variety of goals and values to engage in discourse about which of a set of policy options represents the best reflective compromise.\nPredicting Black Swan Events: The Final Frontier of Machine Learning?\nWonki Her (Seoul National University)\nA Black Swan event is an event with the following three principal characteristics: (i) It is an outlier. (ii) It carries an extreme impact. (iii) After the event, we create an explanation (or a reasonable story) that makes it appear less random and more predictable than it was. World War I, the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the 9/11 attacks, and the death of the Inductivist Turkey are paradigmatic examples. Despite their outlier status, many people want to predict Black Swan events. This is because, if we can predict these Black Swan events, we can defend our lives from disastrous situations. Recently, some machine learning researchers have been trying to build Black Swan prediction machines. However, are these meaningful trials?\nIn this presentation, I will present a skeptical argument against building Black Swan prediction machines. For successful machine predictions, the following conditions need to be satisfied: (i) Large sets of high-quality training data, (ii) A well-defined prediction task, (iii) A well-defined target benchmark or specific standard to assess the prediction model, and (iv) Stable background conditions in the target domain.\nAs we know, in recent years, machine learning models have demonstrated incredible success (e.g., in Go, image recognition, and protein structure prediction). In these cases, the design and training of machine learning models meet the conditions above well. However, unlike games or natural science research, predicting rare social events is difficult because those conditions are hard to satisfy.\nFirst, Black Swan events are very rare, making it difficult to prepare a sufficiently large and high-quality dataset for discovering patterns. Second, defining the prediction task itself is challenging. For instance, should we define it as an event in which 5% of the global population dies within five years? Or should it be defined as an event causing a loss of 1 trillion dollars? Similarly, it is difficult to establish criteria for evaluating prediction models. Most importantly, because our social environment is constantly changing, it is unlikely that a successful Black Swan prediction model will remain effective in the future.\nBeyond environmental changes, we also adjust our behavior based on predictions, which introduces the so-called “Preparedness Paradox.” If we predict a Black Swan event, we will take actions to prevent its occurrence. If these actions are successful, the Black Swan event will not happen. The problem is that in this case, we cannot determine whether the prediction model was useful or not because we do not have something like a twin Earth to test our predictions or treatments.\nIn conclusion, building a Black Swan prediction model is not only extremely difficult but also challenging to evaluate, even if we succeed in creating one.\nContributed Talks 4\nBeyond Opacity: Why Implementation Details Matter in Understanding ML Models\nHyung Suk Lee (Seoul National University)\nScientists rely on hypotheses, theories, and models to grasp and justify phenomena. In contrast, Machine Learning (ML) models, introduced to compensate for the limitations of human cognitive capacity, do not rely on theories, laws, mechanisms, or scientific models. Instead, ML models seek a data model that represents the correct correspondence between the input and output data provided for training. Consequently, the data-driven models produced by ML are largely opaque and incomprehensible to humans.\nIn this situation, there is concern that the scientific values of explanation and understanding will be undermined if scientists increasingly adopt opaque and less understandable ML models for prediction or inference. As the use of ML for scientific purposes is steadily growing, the inability to understand and explain the predictive results produced by ML raises the question of whether the goal of science is shifting from explanation to mere prediction.\nIn response, Sullivan(2022) argues that we are unnecessarily worried due to an improper diagnosis of the phenomenon in which our scientific understanding is limited when using ML models. The opacity of ML models does not harm our understanding; the real problem, she claims, is the lack of scientific evidence linking ML models to phenomena. She argues that to promote explanation and understanding of the real world, we must secure evidence connecting models and phenomena, and that knowing more about the internal implementation state of a model does not increase our understanding of the world.\nI believe that Sullivan’s claim that implementation opacity does not hinder understanding of ML models is incorrect. She has merely turned her head away from a harsh reality. Without resolving implementation opacity, we cannot understand the predictions of ML models.\nFirst, I will analyze the three examples provided by Sullivan (Schelling’s segregation model, melanoma detection model, and sexual orientation prediction model) to clarify what she means by “link uncertainty.” This analysis will demonstrate that the connection between model and phenomenon, as Sullivan describes it, is formed through two stages: first, replacing the ML model with a human-cognizable surrogate model, and second, connecting this surrogate model to a traditional scientific model that represents the phenomenon. Next, I will show that if we fail to grasp the implementation process of the ML model, even if the first stage of connection is achieved by replacing the ML model with a human-cognizable surrogate model using sufficiently developed xAI techniques, the success of the second stage can be highly precarious. Consequently, I argue that Sullivan’s claim that we can gain scientific understanding through ML models even without resolving implementation opacity is unacceptable, because without resolving implementation opacity, we cannot resolve link uncertainty.\nAI as a Pathway to Scientific Knowledge?\nNikolaj Jang Lee Linding Pedersen (Yonsei University)\nJens Christian Bjerring (Aarhus University)\nArtificial Intelligence is increasingly positioned as a transformative tool in the pursuit of scientific knowledge, reshaping how we collect, analyze, and interpret data. But under what conditions can an AI system produce scientific knowledge?\nReliability is required for knowledge (or so we shall assume here). A true belief qualifies as knowledge only if it is formed via a reliable belief-forming method or process (i.e. one that generates mostly true beliefs). Thus, true AI-based scientific beliefs qualify as knowledge only if they are formed via reliable AI methods or belief-forming processes (i.e. methods or processes that take AI outcomes as input and deliver beliefs as outputs). We argue that, while reliability may be a necessary condition for AI-based knowledge, it—together with truth—is not sufficient. Reliability must be supplemented by a condition which ensures that the relevant AI belief-forming method or process does not take highly inaccurate inputs.\nWe home in on this condition through considerations on the distinctive nature of the types of errors that AI systems may make.  AI systems can sometimes make “crazy” or “astounding” errors—e.g., classifying a bird as a car. These kinds of errors seem qualitatively different from those that humans would typically make. They do not merely reflect minor inaccuracies but instead reveal extreme failures seemingly disconnected from the data being processed.\nIt is epistemically risky to form beliefs via methods or processes that take such mistaken AI-generated outcomes as inputs, as it undermines the prospects of knowledge. This point is articulated and argued within a framework featuring two levels of epistemic evaluation: the epistemic value of belief outputs of methods or processes and the accuracy of their inputs. Epistemic value  is trichotomous. There are three epistemic values: truth, falsity, and knowledge. Accuracy takes values in the unit interval, i.e. real numbers in [0; 1].\nThe condition that belief-forming methods and processes not take highly inaccurate inputs is a maximin-style condition. The minimum accuracy of inputs must not be too low. Failing this condition means forming beliefs via a method or process that sometimes takes highly inaccurate inputs. This is epistemically risky as it is incompatible with knowledge. Hence, highly inaccurate inputs undermine the prospects of knowledge.\nWe offer the following diagnosis of the connection between high inaccuracy and knowledge: for a belief-forming method or process that takes outputs from source S as input, the competence of S is undermined if some of S’s outputs are wildly inaccurate. However, a source’s failure to be competent means that it cannot serve as a basis for knowledge—even if forming beliefs on the basis of its deliverances leads to the formation of mostly true beliefs. Thus, AI systems that sometimes deliver highly inaccurate outputs cannot serve as the basis of knowledge, even if most beliefs formed on the basis of their outputs are true. This is because such AI systems fail to exhibit competence.\nProgram",

S. 쿤에 따르면, 과학은 전문화된 연구 영역에서 아직 해결되지 않은 퍼즐을 해결하는 집단적 활동이며, 이 활동은 구체적인 문제 해결의 하나 이상의 모범적인 사례에 의해 안내됩니다. 오늘날, AI가 필수적인 도구로 활용되는 과학 연구 사례가 점점 더 많아지고 있습니다. AI 에이전트들은 퍼즐을 해결하려는 주관적 동기를 가지고 있지 않지만, 쿤적인 방식으로 일부 퍼즐을 해결하거나, 적어도 (인간) 과학자들이 그렇게 할 수 있도록 도와주는 강력한 행위자로 등장할 것입니다. 이는 과학, 과학자, 그리고 과학적 연구의 개념이 변화할 것임을 시사합니다. AI의 발전이 우리로 하여금 과학을 재정의하도록 이끌 것인가? 저는 이 질문을 여러 관점에서 논의할 것입니다.\n초청 강연 2\n예측적으로 유효한 “외계인적” 특성인가, 인공물인가? 이해불가능한 과학적 진보에 대처하기\n카메론 버크너 (플로리다 대학교)\nAlphaFold와 같은 시스템은 많은 과학적 분석 영역에서 수작업으로 설계된 분석 모델의 이전 성능 상한선을 훨씬 뛰어넘는 예측적 AI 시스템의 전망을 제시합니다. 인간의 과학적 이론이 해결하기에 너무 복잡하거나 혼란스럽다고 여겨졌던 문제에서 예측 정확도를 달성할 수 있는 이러한 시스템의 결과에 동의하지 않기는 어렵습니다. 그러나 이러한 모델들은 어떤 면에서는 인간의 인지적 이해를 넘어서는 특성에 기반하여 예측할 수 있습니다 - 예측적 유용성은 있지만 우리에게 자연스럽거나 인지적으로 접근 가능하지 않은 “외계인적” 속성들입니다. 이 강연에서는 적대적 공격(adversarial attacks)에 대한 논의로 시작하여 이러한 특성들을 분석하고, 데이터 분석을 위해 점점 더 복잡한 딥러닝 모델에 의존하는 과학적 체제에서 이러한 인식론적 상황에 대처하는 방법을 논의할 것입니다.\n초청 강연 3\n전체론자를 위한 고립주의\n앙드레 커티스-트루델 (신시내티 대학교)\n에밀리 설리반 (유트레히트 대학교)\n모델은 종종 그들의 대상 현상을 이상화합니다. 그러나 언제 이상화가 성공적이며 어떻게 이상화를 평가할 수 있을까요? 전체론자들은 모델과 그 이상화를 정당화하고 평가하는 것이 전체론적으로 진행되어야 하며 모델의 개별 부분을 집계하거나 평가하는 기능이 될 수 없다고 주장합니다. 전체론적 주장은, 다양한 압력점에서 발생합니다. 일부 매우 복잡한 모델의 경우, 불투명성과 모델의 다른 부분들 간의 상호작용의 복잡성으로 인해 모델 실패가 어디서 발생하는지 실질적으로 분리하기가 어렵습니다. 다른 경우에는, 고립주의가 더 근본적인 문제를 겪는 것으로 보입니다: 이상화는 모델 자체의 특성을 근본적으로 변경하지 않고는 제거하거나 분리할 수 없습니다. 이 강연에서는 머신러닝에서 매우 복잡한 모델인 AlphaFold의 예를 살펴봅니다. AlphaFold는 전체론적 프로젝트에 적합한 일종의 매우 복잡한 모델의 전형적인 예입니다. 그러나 우리는 AlphaFold의 이상화를 평가하고 그것이 성공에 기여하는 방식을 평가하기 위해 분해와 고립주의가 필요하며(실제로 가능하다고) 주장합니다. 결과적으로, 우리는 전체론자들이 고립주의적 프로젝트를 지지해야 한다고 주장합니다.\n초청 강연 4\nAI와 과학적 발견의 논리\n여연경 (동덕여자대학교)\n딥러닝 AI는 신뢰할 수 있는가? 정확한 단백질 구조 예측으로 유명한 딥러닝 AI인 AlphaFold2는 2024년 노벨 화학상을 수상했습니다. 그 경험적 성공은 분명히 인상적입니다. 그러나 많은 철학자들은 여전히 그것의 인식론적 불투명성에 대해 우려하고 있습니다. 다른 딥러닝 모델과 마찬가지로, AlphaFold2는 “블랙박스”로 작동하는데, 이는 내부 의사결정 과정이 완전히 해석 가능하지 않다는 것을 의미합니다. 이러한 투명성 부족은 근본적인 질문을 제기합니다: 언제 딥러닝 AI를 신뢰해야 하고, 언제 그렇지 않아야 하는가? 딥러닝 AI가 신뢰할 수 있다고 간주되기 위해 충족해야 하는 조건은 무엇인가? 과학적 지식이 딥러닝 AI만으로 도출될 수 있는가? 철학자들은 이러한 우려에 대해 광범위하게 논의해 왔으며, AlphaFold2와 AlphaFold3의 획기적인 성공으로 새로운 질문을 제기할 때입니다: 그들의 경험적 성과가 AlphaFold와 딥러닝 AI에 대한 철학자들의 회의적이거나 비관적인 견해에 도전할 수 있는가?\nDuede(2023)는 딥러닝 AI가 타당한 가설을 생성하는 발견의 맥락에서는 가치가 있을 수 있지만, 과학적 주장이 엄격한 테스트와 확인을 필요로 하는 정당화의 맥락에서는 그렇지 않을 수 있다고 제안합니다. 그러나 이 오래된 구분이 딥러닝 AI를 옹호하는 유일한 방법인가요? AlphaFold2와 같은 인식론적으로 불투명한 시스템이 궁극적으로 신뢰할 수 없다고 결론지어야 하는가?\nOrtmann(2025)은 why-reliability와 whether-reliability를 구분함으로써 이러한 회의론에 도전합니다. 그는 우리가 AlphaFold2가 왜 신뢰할 수 있는지 완전히 이해하지 못하더라도, 여전히 그것이 신뢰할 수 있는지 여부를 판단할 수 있다고 주장합니다. AlphaFold2의 whether-reliability는 이미 그것의 경험적 성공을 통해 입증되었습니다. 더욱이, 현대 과학 연구에서의 광범위한 채택은 그것의 whether-reliability에 대한 추가적인 지지를 제공합니다. 결국, 신뢰할 수 없는 도구는 과학적 실천에서 그렇게 광범위하게 사용되지 않을 것입니다.\n그러나, 많은 회의적인 철학자들은 여전히 설득되지 않을 것입니다. 예를 들어, Duede(2022)는 단순한 귀납적 고려사항만으로는 충분하지 않으며, 투명성이 진정한 신뢰성에 필수적이라고 주장합니다. 마찬가지로, Mitchell(2020)은 신뢰성이 이론의 인식론적 보증과 지지 증거의 안정성의 조합에서 발생하기 때문에, 경험적 성공은 인식론적 보증을 동반해야 한다고 주장합니다.\n이 발표는 Duede와 Mitchell에 대한 응답으로, 문제 해결 휴리스틱 집합으로 이해되는 발견의 논리가 AlphaFold와 딥러닝 AI에 필요한 인식론적 보증을 제공할 수 있는지 탐구합니다. 이 아이디어는 AlphaFold 개발의 기초가 되는 방법과 원칙이 그것의 why-reliability를 확립하기 위한 기초로 기능할 수 있다는 것입니다. AlphaFold의 창조를 이끈 휴리스틱을 명시함으로써, 우리는 AlphaFold와 딥러닝 AI에 요구되는 투명성에 대한 우려를 해결하기 위한 충분한 인식론적 보증을 제공할 수 있을지도 모릅니다.\n초청 강연 5\n찾고 있(지 않)는 것을 발견하기: AI 주도 발견의 전망과 도전\n앙드레 커티스-트루델 (신시내티 대학교)\n머신러닝(ML), 특히 딥러닝(DL) 시스템에 의한 최근의 중요한 과학적 성과는 자동화된 과학적 발견을 위한 ML에 대한 관심을 재활성화했습니다(예: Wang 외, 2023). 이러한 작업의 많은 부분은 DL 방법이 전통적인 이론 중심의 발견 접근법보다 더 효율적으로 현상, 가설, 심지어 모델이나 이론의 발견을 촉진할 수 있다는 생각에 의해 동기 부여됩니다. 이 강연은 최첨단 과학에서 자동화된, DL 주도 발견에 대한 더 구체적인 장애물 중 일부를 고려하며, 대표적인 사례 연구로 중력파 천체물리학(GWA)에 초점을 맞춥니다. 강연의 첫 번째 부분에서, 우리는 이러한 노력에도 불구하고 GWA에서 DL 주도 발견의 전망이 여전히 불확실하다고 주장합니다. 두 번째 부분에서, 우리는 DL이 기존의 발견 방법을 증강하거나 향상시키는 데 사용될 수 있는 방법과, 이러한 사용과 관련된 인식론적 미덕과 악덕에 대한 관심의 전환을 지지합니다. 우리는 이러한 많은 사용의 주요 인식론적 미덕이 퍼즐이나 이상 신호를 조사하는 것과 관련된 기회 비용을 감소시키는 것이며, 이러한 사용을 평가하기 위한 올바른 프레임워크는 추구가치성(pursuitworthiness)에 관한 철학적 작업에서 나온다고 주장합니다.\n초청 강연 6\n설명 가능한 AI의 도덕적 중요성\n케이트 브레덴버그 (런던 정치경제대학)\nAI 시스템을 이해하는 것은 인식론적으로뿐만 아니라 도덕적으로도 중요합니다. 이 강연에서, 저는 세 가지를 할 것입니다. 첫째, 우리가 예측 기계와 에이전트라고 부를 수 있는 두 가지 다른 유형의 AI 시스템에 대해 중요한 도덕적 가치에 대한 설명을 주장할 것입니다. 저는 예측 기계의 경우 정보에 입각한 자기 옹호를 가능하게 하는 것이 중요하며, 에이전트의 경우 신뢰와 대인 존중과 같은 가치가 중요하다고 주장합니다. 따라서 AI 시스템의 유형은 우리가 어떤 종류의 설명을 목표로 해야 하는지, 그리고 XAI에서의 상응하는 과학적 패러다임에 대한 영향을 미칩니다. 둘째, 예측 기계의 경우, 저는 신용 평가의 예를 사용하여 어떤 속성 P를 가진 사람이 되는 방법과 어떤 속성 P를 가진 사람으로 판단받는 방법을 설명하는 것 사이에 근본적인 긴장이 있다고 주장할 것입니다. 정적 모델링 선택과 불확실성 때문에, 둘은 분리됩니다. 후자는 수학적 관점에서 매력적이지만, 개인에 대한 실수 비용을 줄이는 배경 기관이 필요합니다. 그러나 전자는 정보에 입각한 자기 옹호를 적절히 가능하게 하지 않을 수 있습니다. 셋째, 저는 대인 간 정당화가 인공 에이전트를 포함한 에이전트에게 중요하지만, 정당화를 제공하기 위해서는 인공 에이전트가 부족한 이유와 사회적 규범에 대한 응답성이 필요하다고 주장할 것입니다.\n초청 강연 7\n의료분야의 파운데이션 모델은 신뢰성에 대한 재고를 요구한다\n토마스 그로테 (튀빙겐 대학교)\n파운데이션 모델이라고 불리는 새로운 종류의 AI 모델이 의료 분야에 진입했습니다. 파운데이션 모델은 신뢰성을 평가하기 위한 표준 머신러닝 패러다임의 몇 가지 기본 원칙을 위반합니다 - 그들은 훈련 중에 보았을 수 있는 데이터로 테스트되고, 다양하고 종종 불투명한 출처의 데이터로 훈련되며, 목적에 대한 적합성을 평가하기 어려운 출력을 생성합니다. 이러한 위반은 파운데이션 모델에 대한 보증된 신뢰를 확립하기 위해 우리가 어떤 보증을 요구하는지 재고할 필요가 있게 만듭니다.\n일반 발표 1\n도구 그 이상: 코딩 AI와의 협업이 인지, 행위성, 그리고 주관성을 재형성하는 방식\n권유빈 (서울대학교)\nAI와 함께 일한다는 것은, 무엇을 의미하는가? 효과적인 협업을 위해 어떤 변화가 필요한가? AI와의 협업이 인지, 행위성, 주관성에 대한 우리의 이해를 어떻게 재형성하는가?\nAI는 학습, 문제 해결, 자율적 의사 결정과 같은 전통적으로 인간 인지와 관련된 기능을 수행할 수 있는 능력에서 이전 기술과 구별됩니다. OpenAI의 ChatGPT 출시 이후, 다양한 부문의 직장들은 생성형 AI를 워크플로우에 통합하고 인간-AI 팀을 관리하는 방법에 대한 중요한 질문을 불러일으키며 통합하는 방법을 탐색해 왔습니다.\n소프트웨어 개발 커뮤니티에서, GitHub Copilot과 같은 코딩 AI 도구들은 빠르게 인기를 얻어 개발자들의 관행에 필수적이 되었습니다. 이 발표는 GitHub Copilot, Code Whisperer, Claude, ChatGPT를 포함한 코딩 AI를 정기적으로 사용하는 30명의 개발자들과의 심층 인터뷰와 그들의 워크플로우에 대한 관찰 연구에 기반합니다. 개발자들은 AI를 단순히 도구로 사용하는 것을 넘어서 - 그들은 AI를 조수, 파트너, 때로는 자신의 확장으로 대우합니다. 주목할 만하게, 개발자들은 의도와 목표를 AI에 적극적으로 “가르치고”, 반복적인 상호작용과 피드백을 통해 점차적으로 AI를 그들의 ’디지털 분신’으로 형성합니다. 이는 개발자들이 단순히 AI에 작업을 위임하는 것이 아니라 - 자신의 사고 과정을 AI와 공유하고 있음을 보여줍니다.\n인지 및 인간-기계 인터페이스 프레임워크를 사용하여, 이 발표는 인간과 비인간 행위성 모두의 역할을 강조하며 인간-AI 협업에서 행위성의 역동적인 전개를 탐구합니다. 분산 인지와 인지적 조립체와 같은 프레임워크는 이러한 상호작용에서 인지 과정이 어떻게 재분배되고 재구성되는지 조명합니다. 개발자들은 점점 더 AI를 단순한 도구가 아니라 자신의 인지 과정의 확장으로 보게 되어, 인지적 조립체라고 부를 수 있는 것이 됩니다. 인간 개발자와 코딩 AI 사이의 상호작용 분석을 통해, 이 발표는 AI와의 일상적인 상호작용에서 인지와 행위성의 복잡한 얽힘을 반영하는 확장된 주관성 개념의 필요성을 보여줍니다.\n분산적이고 확률적인 표상 모델\n최이선 (이화여자대학교)\n세계의 표상은 어떻게 구성되는가? 대략적으로 말하자면, 표상 시스템은 외부 소스로부터 데이터를 받아, 입력 시스템을 통해 그것을 인코딩하고, 내부 시스템에서 이 인코딩된 정보를 결합하여 작업 메모리에 전달하고 유지합니다. 우리의 세계 표상은 가필드, 톰, 체셔와 같은 개별 엔티티에 대한 정보뿐만 아니라 고양이와 같은 범주에 대한 표상도 포함합니다. 이러한 범주를 개념이라고 합니다. 우리는 개념을 사용하여 세계를 표상합니다.\n인공지능에서의 표상 시스템에 관한 연구는 크게 두 과정으로 나눌 수 있습니다. 첫 번째는 개념 적용 과정으로, 새롭게 제공된 정보가 기존 개념적 프레임워크 내에서 어떻게 분류되는지 설명합니다. 두 번째는 개념 형성 과정으로, 데이터를 기반으로 새로운 개념이 어떻게 생성되는지 설명합니다. 이 연구는 후자에 초점을 맞추어, 개념 형성을 통해 세계 표상이 어떻게 결정되는지 논의합니다.\n이 연구는 인공지능과 인지과학의 두 가지 주요 이론인 분산 표상(distributed representation)과 확률적 표상(probabilistic representation)을 통합하는 새로운 표상 이론을 제안합니다. 딥러닝의 핵심 이론인 분산 표상, 특히 자연어 처리와 컴퓨터 비전에서는 여러 차원으로 구성된 특징 공간에 데이터를 배치합니다. 예를 들어, 고양이 이미지는 윤곽, 모서리, 색상, 질감과 같은 저수준 특징을 추출하여 표현되고, 이것은 “귀를 가짐” 또는 “꼬리를 가짐”과 같은 더 복잡한 특징으로 결합됩니다. 이 특징 공간은 고차원 좌표계로 볼 수 있으며, 각 특징은 축으로 작용하고, 입력 데이터는 이 공간에서 단일 점 또는 벡터로 표현됩니다. 하나의 점은 다양한 특징의 조합으로 이해될 수 있습니다.\n반면에, 확률적 표상 모델은 개념 형성 과정을 특정 우도 함수를 사용하여 특징 공간에서 데이터 클러스터를 분석하는 것으로 해석합니다. 밀집된 데이터 클러스터, 특히 다른 클러스터와 분리된 클러스터는 단일 개념으로 개별화될 가능성이 더 높습니다. 반대로, 희소한 클러스터나 여러 클러스터가 있는 패턴은 여러 개념으로 해석될 가능성이 더 높습니다. 이 모델은 “신의 관점”과 같은 특권적인 세계 표상이 존재하지 않는다고 가정하고, 동일한 데이터를 기반으로 다양한 관찰자가 동등한 세계 표상을 구성할 가능성을 열어줍니다. 이는 인간 표상의 특성과 일치하며 새로운 개념의 출현 조건도 설정합니다.\n그러나 다른 세계 표상 모델이 존재한다면, 그것들은 서로 번역 가능해야 합니다. 그렇지 않으면 각 모델은 고립적으로 유아론적인 위험이 있습니다. 이 연구는 Kullback-Leibler 발산에 기반한 정량적 지표를 사용하여 서로 다른 특징 공간에서 개념의 일치도를 평가하고, 개념 간의 일관성과 차이를 평가하는 방법을 제안합니다.\n그럼에도 불구하고, 분산 표상과 확률적 표상의 통합에는 몇 가지 제한이 따릅니다. 예를 들어, 특징 공간의 구성 - 어떤 특징과 얼마나 많은 특징이 포함되는지 - 은 동일한 외부 입력 데이터에 대해 완전히 다른 클러스터로 이어질 수 있습니다. 이러한 불일치는 모델 간에 개념 기반 클러스터를 번역하는 것을 어렵게 만들고, 모든 세계 표상 모델이 특징 공간의 동일한 차원 구조를 공유한다고 가정하는 것의 제약을 강조합니다. 이 연구는 이러한 제한이 표상 모델 설계에 미치는 영향을 탐구하고 통합된 표상 이론의 가능성과 경계를 조사합니다.\n일반 발표 2\n인공적 가능성\n보야나 그루지치치 (막스 플랑크 인지 스쿨)\n과학은 종종 사고 실험과 모델링을 통해 가능성, 우연성, 필연성과 관련된 문제를 다룹니다. 이 발표는 인지 과학에서 딥 뉴럴 네트워크를 사용함으로써 얼마나 많은 양식적 과학적 이해를 얻을 수 있는지 논의합니다. 신경망의 인식론적으로 유용한 특징 중 하나는 실행 가능성입니다 - 신경망은 인지적 작업을 수행하도록 훈련될 수 있으며, 새로운 자극이 주어졌을 때 실행될 수 있어 귀납적 편향 집합에 기반한 인지 현상의 가능성을 보여줍니다. 저는 가능성에 대한 신경망 기반 추론의 정당화 문제에 초점을 맞추고 타당한 정당화 전략을 개략적으로 설명합니다. 저는 신경망이 보여주는 가능성을 생물학적 가능성이 아닌 기술적 가능성으로 간주하는 여러 이유를 고려합니다. 그럼에도 불구하고, 저는 그것들이 인지 현상에 대한 우리의 양식적 과학적 이해에 기여한다고 주장합니다.\n증강된 지성: 과학적 이해에서 확장된 마음으로서의 AI\n우인진 (성균관대학교)\n이 논문에서, 저는 인공지능(AI)이 (사회적으로) 확장된 인지의 메커니즘을 통해 과학적 이해를 발전시킨다고 주장합니다. 많은 연구자들은 AI가 AGI에 도달하면 의도성과 자율성과 같은 행위자성의 특정 조건을 만족시킬 수 있다고 추측합니다. 확장된 인지의 개념적 프레임워크를 검토하고 Pritchard와 Khalifa의 인식론적 관점을 통합함으로써, 저는 AI가 어떻게 전통적인 도구 기반 인지를 초월하여 과학적 이해의 적극적인 참여자가 되는지 보여드립니다.\nAI는 Chalmers와 Clark(1998)이 정의한 대로 확장된 인지로 간주될 수 있습니다. 확장된 인지는 인간의 인지 과정을 외부 환경이나 도구와 통합하는 것을 포함합니다. 세 가지 필수 조건이 충족되어야 합니다: 신뢰할 수 있는 결합, 직접적인 가용성, 자동적인 승인입니다. AI는 일관되고 신뢰할 수 있게 작동하면서 인간 생활에 깊이 통합되어 있습니다(예: AI 비서). AI는 질문이나 명령에 즉시 응답하여 실시간으로 인간의 인지적 요구를 지원합니다. AI 시스템은 반복적인 사용과 긍정적인 경험을 통해 사용자의 신뢰를 얻습니다. 스마트폰이 초기 기술적 한계에도 불구하고 확장된 인지로 기능할 수 있는 잠재력을 보여준 것처럼, AI 또한 확장된 인지를 구성할 잠재력을 가지고 있습니다(Helliwell, 2019).\n확장된 인지의 개념을 기반으로, 이제 사회적으로 확장된 인지의 아이디어로 눈을 돌립니다. Pritchard(2022)는 협업이 이해에 어떻게 기여하는지 강조함으로써 과학적 지식을 설명합니다. 사회적으로 확장된 인지는 다른 사람들의 정보 처리 활동이 개인의 인지 과정에 통합되어 개인 능력을 넘어선 지식으로 이어질 때 발생합니다. AI가 행위자성을 가지고 있다면, 그것은 우리의 사회적으로 확장된 인지의 일부로 기능할 수 있습니다. AI는 직접적인 가용성이 부족할 수 있는 인간 협업과 달리, 인간과의 협업을 통해 인지 과정을 지원하고 보완합니다. AI는 이러한 제한을 최소화하거나 제거하여 사회적으로 확장된 인지의 형태로서의 역할을 강화합니다. Pritchard는 과학적 지식에 대한 논의를 제한했지만, 저는 그것을 과학적 이해에 관한 연구와 통합하는 것을 목표로 합니다.\n이 사회적으로 확장된 인지가 단지 과학적 지식뿐만 아니라 과학적 이해를 어떻게 향상시키는지 파악하기 위해, 우리는 Khalifa의 EKS 모델로 눈을 돌립니다. Khalifa는 과학적 설명적 평가(SEEing)를 통해 얻은 설명적 지식이 이해의 핵심이라고 강조합니다. EKS 모델에서의 SEEing은 타당한 잠재적 설명의 범위를 고려하고 비교한 다음, 증거와 다른 설명적 고려사항에 기반하여 가장 설득력 있는 것을 선택하는 과정입니다. 이 과학적 탐구 과정은 단순한 믿음을 넘어서 우연적이거나 우발적인 요소를 최소화하는 잘 정당화되고 신뢰할 수 있는 이해로 이어집니다. 따라서, AI는 도구로서든 협업 파트너로서든 SEEing을 향상시키는 데 중요한 역할을 합니다.\n이 논의를 바탕으로, AI가 과학적 이해에 어떻게 기여하는지에 대한 과학자들의 연구(Krenn 외, 2022)에 대한 비판적 검토는 세 가지 주요 차원을 강조합니다: (1) 계산적 현미경, (2) 영감의 자원, (3) 이해의 에이전트입니다. 데이터 처리 및 평가 도구로서, AI는 연구자들이 잠재적 설명을 비교하고 가장 설득력 있는 것을 식별하는 능력을 향상시킵니다. 협력자로서, AI는 가설을 생성하고, 프레임워크를 정제하고, 인간의 인지를 향상시켜 과학적 평가를 강화합니다. 이러한 두 가지 역할을 통해, AI는 SEEing의 과정을 변형시켜 궁극적으로 향상된 과학적 이해에 기여합니다.\n자율무기체계와 정의로운 전쟁 이론: 정전론(Jus in Bello) 원칙에 대한 비판적 재평가\n김상수 (육군사관학교)\n인공지능(AI)의 혁명적인 발전에 의해 주도되는 자율무기체계(AWS)의 출현은 현대 전쟁을 근본적으로 변화시켜, 정의로운 전쟁 이론(JWT) 프레임워크 내의 정전론(jus in bello) 원칙에 대한 비판적 재평가를 요구합니다. AI 혁신의 산물인 AWS는 독립적으로 작동하여 인간의 개입 없이 중요한 결정을 내림으로써 운영 효율성을 향상시킵니다. 그러나 그들의 자율성은 JWT 하에서 차별과 비례성의 핵심 원칙을 준수할 수 있는 능력에 대한 심각한 윤리적 우려를 제기합니다. 이러한 우려는 AWS가 인간의 생명에 직접적인 영향을 미치는 결정을 포함하는 무기 시스템이라는 점을 고려할 때 특히 중요하며, 그들의 사용을 관리하기 위한 강력한 윤리적 프레임워크의 긴급한 필요성을 강조합니다.\n정전론은 전쟁 수행을 규제하는 일련의 윤리적 원칙으로, 전쟁에 관련된 모든 도덕적 행위자가 그 기준을 유지하도록 요구합니다. 국제적 맥락에서 널리 받아들여지는 기본적인 도덕적 지침으로서, 이러한 원칙들은 전쟁의 불가피한 상황에서도 개인의 존엄성과 권리를 보장하기 위한 최소한의 윤리적 프레임워크로 봉사합니다. 특히, 차별과 비례성은 무고한 민간인을 보호하고 무력 사용이 정당한 군사적 목표와 엄격하게 일치하도록 보장함으로써 전쟁의 도덕적 정당성을 유지하는 데 핵심적입니다.\n차별의 원칙은 전투원과 비전투원 사이의 명확한 구분을 요구하여, 민간인과 다른 보호 대상을 불필요한 해로부터 보호합니다. 이 원칙은 의사 결정자가 복잡한 전장 시나리오를 평가하고 국제 인도주의법과 일치하는 판단을 내릴 수 있다고 가정합니다. 그럼에도 불구하고, 사전 프로그래밍된 알고리즘과 데이터셋에 의존하는 AWS는 역동적이고 예측 불가능한 환경에서 비전투원을 정확하게 식별하는 데 상당한 도전에 직면합니다. 불완전하거나 편향된 데이터셋이 AWS 의사 결정에 영향을 미칠 때, 차별 원칙의 심각한 위반 위험이 높아집니다.\n비례성의 원칙은 군사 행동으로 인한 해악이 예상되는 군사적 이점과 균형을 이루어야 한다고 요구합니다. 이 원칙은 단순한 계산을 넘어서, 도덕적 및 맥락적 요소를 포함하는 미묘한 평가를 요구합니다. 그러나 AWS는 사전 정의된 매개변수에 기반하여 작동하여, 실제 상황의 복잡성을 고려하지 못할 가능성이 있습니다. 예상치 못한 결과의 가능성은 AWS가 실제로 비례성 원칙을 일관되게 유지할 수 있는지에 대한 의문을 더욱 제기합니다.\n이 발표는 AWS가 차별과 비례성의 원칙을 효과적으로 준수할 수 있는지를 비판적으로 검토합니다. 전투원과 비전투원을 구별하고, 불법적인 목표를 피하고, 인간의 도덕적 기준에 부합하는 결정을 내리는 AWS의 기술적, 윤리적 능력을 평가합니다. 또한, AWS에 의한 치명적인 힘의 사용이 비례성 원칙 하에서 정당화될 수 있는지 탐구하고, 이러한 윤리적 원칙을 준수하기 위해 인간의 감독이 필요한 정도를 논의합니다.\n발표는 세 가지 주요 논의를 중심으로 구성됩니다. 첫째, AWS의 기술적 특성과 운영 역할을 분석하여 JWT의 확립된 원칙과 일치하는지 평가합니다. 둘째, 차별과 비례성의 윤리적, 실질적 해석을 재평가하여 AWS에 적용 가능성을 결정합니다. 셋째, 현대 전쟁에서 AWS와 같은 첨단 기술이 제기하는 윤리적 도전을 반영하도록 정전론 원칙을 재구성하는 대안적 접근법을 제안합니다.\n궁극적으로, 이 발표는 AI 혁신에서 기원하고 생명과 죽음의 의미를 가진 AWS를 면밀히 조사하는 윤리적 긴급성을 강조합니다. 정전론의 윤리적 경계 내에서 AWS를 평가하기 위한 프레임워크를 제공하여, 기술적 혁신과 도덕적 책임성의 균형을 맞추는 것을 목표로 합니다. 이 접근법은 정의와 인간성이 진화하는 분쟁의 맥락에서 중심에 남아 있도록 보장하면서 현대 전쟁의 윤리적 기준을 재정의하는 데 기여합니다.\n일반 발표 3\n예측, 투영, 그리고 수행성\n콘스탄틴 제닌 (튀빙겐 대학교)\n사회적 맥락에서 예측은 미래 결과에 대한 단순한 인과적으로 무력한 예견이 아니라 예측하려는 결과에 인과적 영향을 미친다는 것이 널리 인식되고 있습니다. 이는 특히 예측이 정책 결정에 직접적으로 영향을 미칠 때 그렇습니다. 예측이 자기 충족적이거나 자기 부정적일 수 있을 때, 실용적 고려사항과 인식론적 고려사항이 얽혀 있고, 정확성의 개념이 모호해집니다. 더욱이, 귀납적 위험의 개념은 재고되어야 합니다: 가치는 다른 종류의 오류의 결과를 고려해야 하기 때문에만 작용하는 것이 아니라, 예측이 잘못된 이유로 옳을 수 있다는 우려 때문에도 작용합니다. 수행성에 대처하는 방법에 대해 많은 제안이 이루어졌으며, 여기에는 수행적 효과를 “내재화”하거나, 사회적으로 바람직한 방향으로 결과를 유도하는 예측을 하는 것 등이 있습니다. 우리는 이러한 접근법이 잘못되었다고 주장합니다. 많은 바람직하지 않은 수행적 효과는 머신러닝 모델의 출력이 어떤 정책이 채택될 것인지 암묵적으로 추측하여 결과를 예측하는 예측과, 어떤 정책 옵션이 선택된다면 결과를 예측하는 반사실적 투영 사이에서 모호하기 때문에 발생합니다. 예측과 투영의 올바른 구별을 하면, 실용적 문제와 인식론적 문제를 깨끗하게 구별할 수 있습니다. 우리는 정확한 투영을 목표로 함으로써만 머신러닝 모델이 의사결정을 지원할 뿐만 아니라 담론을 지원할 수 있다고 주장합니다: 다양한 목표와 가치를 가진 논의자들이 정책 옵션 세트 중 어느 것이 최선의 반성적 타협을 나타내는지에 대한 담론에 참여할 수 있도록 관련 투영을 제공합니다.\n블랙 스완 이벤트 예측하기: 머신러닝의 최종 개척지?\n허원기 (서울대학교)\n블랙 스완 이벤트는 다음 세 가지 주요 특성을 가진 이벤트입니다: (i) 그것은 이상치입니다.

(iii) 이벤트 이후, 우리는 그것이 실제보다 덜 무작위적이고 더 예측 가능하게 보이도록 하는 설명(또는 합리적인 이야기)을 만듭니다. 제1차 세계 대전, 소련의 해체, 9/11 테러, 귀납주의자 칠면조의 죽음은 전형적인 예입니다. 그들의 이상치 상태에도 불구하고, 많은 사람들이 블랙 스완 이벤트를 예측하고 싶어합니다. 이는 우리가 이러한 블랙 스완 이벤트를 예측할 수 있다면, 재앙적인 상황으로부터 우리의 삶을 방어할 수 있기 때문입니다. 최근, 일부 머신러닝 연구자들은 블랙 스완 예측 기계를 구축하려고 시도해 왔습니다. 그러나, 이것들은 의미 있는 시도입니까?\n이 발표에서, 저는 블랙 스완 예측 기계 구축에 대한 회의적인 논증을 제시할 것입니다. 성공적인 머신 예측을 위해서는 다음 조건들이 충족되어야 합니다: (i) 대량의 고품질 훈련 데이터, (ii) 잘 정의된 예측 작업, (iii) 예측 모델을 평가하기 위한 잘 정의된 대상 벤치마크 또는 특정 기준, (iv) 대상 도메인의 안정적인 배경 조건입니다.\n우리가 알다시피, 최근 몇 년 동안 머신러닝 모델은 놀라운 성공을 보여주었습니다(예: 바둑, 이미지 인식, 단백질 구조 예측). 이러한 경우, 머신러닝 모델의 설계와 훈련은 위의 조건을 잘 충족합니다. 그러나, 게임이나 자연 과학 연구와 달리, 희귀한 사회적 이벤트를 예측하는 것은 그러한 조건을 충족하기 어렵기 때문에 어렵습니다.\n첫째, 블랙 스완 이벤트는 매우 희귀하여, 패턴을 발견하기 위한 충분히 크고 고품질의 데이터셋을 준비하기 어렵습니다. 둘째, 예측 작업 자체를 정의하는 것이 어렵습니다. 예를 들어, 5년 내에 세계 인구의 5%가 사망하는 이벤트로 정의해야 할까요? 아니면 1조 달러의 손실을 초래하는 이벤트로 정의해야 할까요? 마찬가지로, 예측 모델을 평가하기 위한 기준을 설정하기도 어렵습니다. 가장 중요하게는, 우리의 사회적 환경이 끊임없이 변화하고 있기 때문에, 성공적인 블랙 스완 예측 모델이 미래에도 효과적으로 유지될 가능성이 낮습니다.\n환경 변화 외에도, 우리는 예측에 기반하여 행동을 조정하는데, 이는 소위 “준비성 역설”을 도입합니다. 블랙 스완 이벤트를 예측하면, 우리는 그것의 발생을 방지하기 위한 조치를 취할 것입니다. 이러한 조치가 성공적이라면, 블랙 스완 이벤트는 발생하지 않을 것입니다. 문제는 이 경우, 우리의 예측이나 치료를 테스트할 수 있는 쌍둥이 지구와 같은 것이 없기 때문에 예측 모델이 유용했는지 여부를 결정할 수 없다는 것입니다.\n결론적으로, 블랙 스완 예측 모델을 구축하는 것은 매우 어려울 뿐만 아니라, 만약 성공하더라도 평가하기 어렵습니다.\n일반 발표 4\n불투명성을 넘어서: ML 모델 이해에 있어 구현 세부사항이 중요한 이유\n이형석 (서울대학교)\n과학자들은 현상을 파악하고 정당화하기 위해 가설, 이론, 모델에 의존합니다. 반면에, 인간 인지 능력의 한계를 보완하기 위해 도입된 머신러닝(ML) 모델은 이론, 법칙, 메커니즘, 또는 과학적 모델에 의존하지 않습니다. 대신, ML 모델은 훈련을 위해 제공된 입력과 출력 데이터 사이의 올바른 대응을 나타내는 데이터 모델을 찾습니다. 결과적으로, ML에 의해 생성된 데이터 중심 모델은 대부분 불투명하고 인간이 이해하기 어렵습니다.\n이러한 상황에서, 과학자들이 예측이나 추론을 위해 불투명하고 이해하기 어려운 ML 모델을 점점 더 채택한다면 설명과 이해의 과학적 가치가 훼손될 것이라는 우려가 있습니다. 과학적 목적을 위한 ML 사용이 꾸준히 증가함에 따라, ML이 생성한 예측 결과를 이해하고 설명할 수 없는 것은 과학의 목표가 설명에서 단순한 예측으로 이동하고 있는지에 대한 의문을 제기합니다.\n이에 대응하여, Sullivan(2022)은 ML 모델을 사용할 때 우리의 과학적 이해가 제한되는 현상에 대한 부적절한 진단으로 인해 우리가 불필요하게 걱정하고 있다고 주장합니다. ML 모델의 불투명성은 우리의 이해를 해치지 않습니다; 그녀가 주장하는 실제 문제는 ML 모델과 현상을 연결하는 과학적 증거의 부족입니다. 그녀는 실제 세계의 설명과 이해를 촉진하기 위해서는 모델과 현상을 연결하는 증거를 확보해야 하며, 모델의 내부 구현 상태에 대해 더 많이 아는 것이 세계에 대한 우리의 이해를 증가시키지 않는다고 주장합니다.\n저는 구현 불투명성이 ML 모델의 이해를 방해하지 않는다는 Sullivan의 주장이 잘못되었다고 생각합니다. 그녀는 단지 가혹한 현실에서 고개를 돌렸을 뿐입니다. 구현 불투명성을 해결하지 않고는 ML 모델의 예측을 이해할 수 없습니다.\n첫째, 저는 Sullivan이 제공한 세 가지 예(Schelling의 분리 모델, 흑색종 감지 모델, 성적 지향 예측 모델)를 분석하여 그녀가 말하는 “링크 불확실성”이 무엇을 의미하는지 명확히 할 것입니다. 이 분석은 Sullivan이 설명하는 모델과 현상 사이의 연결이 두 단계를 통해 형성된다는 것을 보여줄 것입니다: 첫째, ML 모델을 인간이 인식할 수 있는 대리 모델로 대체하고, 둘째, 이 대리 모델을 현상을 나타내는 전통적인 과학적 모델에 연결하는 것입니다. 다음으로, 저는 ML 모델의 구현 과정을 파악하지 못하면, 충분히 발전된 xAI 기술을 사용하여 ML 모델을 인간이 인식할 수 있는 대리 모델로 대체함으로써 연결의 첫 번째 단계가 달성되더라도, 두 번째 단계의 성공이 매우 불안정할 수 있음을 보여줄 것입니다. 결과적으로, 저는 구현 불투명성을 해결하지 않고도 ML 모델을 통해 과학적 이해를 얻을 수 있다는 Sullivan의 주장이 받아들일 수 없다고 주장합니다. 왜냐하면 구현 불투명성을 해결하지 않고는 링크 불확실성을 해결할 수 없기 때문입니다.\nAI는 과학적 지식의 경로가 될 수 있는가?\n니콜라이 장 리 린딩 페더슨 (연세대학교)\n옌스 크리스티안 비예링 (오르후스 대학교)\n인공지능은 데이터를 수집, 분석, 해석하는 방식을 재형성하며 과학적 지식을 추구하는 데 있어 변혁적인 도구로서 점점 더 자리매김하고 있습니다. 그러나 어떤 조건 하에서 AI 시스템이 과학적 지식을 생산할 수 있을까요?\n지식에는 신뢰성이 요구됩니다(여기서는 그렇게 가정할 것입니다). 진실된 믿음은 신뢰할 수 있는 믿음 형성 방법이나 과정(즉, 대부분 참된 믿음을 생성하는 것)을 통해 형성된 경우에만 지식으로 자격을 갖습니다. 따라서, 진실된 AI 기반 과학적 믿음은 신뢰할 수 있는 AI 방법이나 믿음 형성 과정(즉, AI 결과를 입력으로 취하고 믿음을 출력으로 전달하는 방법이나 과정)을 통해 형성된 경우에만 지식으로 자격을 갖습니다. 우리는 신뢰성이 AI 기반 지식의 필요 조건일 수 있지만, 진실과 함께 충분하지 않다고 주장합니다. 신뢰성은 관련 AI 믿음 형성 방법이나 과정이 매우 부정확한 입력을 취하지 않도록 보장하는 조건으로 보완되어야 합니다.\n우리는 AI 시스템이 만들 수 있는 오류의 특징적 성격에 대한 고려를 통해 이 조건에 집중합니다. AI 시스템은 때때로 “미친” 또는 “놀라운” 오류를 범할 수 있습니다 - 예를 들어, 새를 자동차로 분류하는 것과 같은 오류입니다. 이러한 종류의 오류는 인간이 일반적으로 범하는 오류와 질적으로 다른 것으로 보입니다. 그것들은 단순히 사소한 부정확성을 반영하는 것이 아니라 처리되는 데이터와 연결되지 않은 것처럼 보이는 극단적인 실패를 드러냅니다.\n이런 잘못된 AI 생성 결과를 입력으로 취하는 방법이나 과정을 통해 믿음을 형성하는 것은 지식의 전망을 훼손하기 때문에 인식론적으로 위험합니다. 이 점은 두 수준의 인식론적 평가를 특징으로 하는 프레임워크 내에서 명확히 되고 주장됩니다: 방법이나 과정의 믿음 출력의 인식론적 가치와 그 입력의 정확성입니다. 인식론적 가치는 삼분법적입니다. 세 가지 인식론적 가치가 있습니다: 진실, 거짓, 그리고 지식입니다. 정확성은 단위 간격, 즉 [0; 1]의 실수 값을 취합니다.\n믿음 형성 방법과 과정이 고도로 부정확한 입력을 취하지 않아야 한다는 조건은 최대최소 스타일의 조건입니다. 입력의 최소 정확성이 너무 낮지 않아야 합니다. 이 조건을 충족하지 못한다는 것은 때때로 고도로 부정확한 입력을 취하는 방법이나 과정을 통해 믿음을 형성한다는 것을 의미합니다. 이는 지식과 양립할 수 없기 때문에 인식론적으로 위험합니다. 따라서, 고도로 부정확한 입력은 지식의 전망을 훼손합니다.\n우리는 높은 부정확성과 지식 사이의 연결에 대해 다음과 같은 진단을 제공합니다: 소스 S로부터의 출력을 입력으로 취하는 믿음 형성 방법이나 과정의 경우, S의 일부 출력이 극도로 부정확하다면 S의 역량이 훼손됩니다. 그러나, 소스가 역량을 갖추지 못한다는 것은 그것의 전달에 기반하여 믿음을 형성하는 것이 대부분 참된 믿음으로 이어진다 하더라도 지식의 기초로 기능할 수 없다는 것을 의미합니다. 따라서, 때때로 고도로 부정확한 출력을 제공하는 AI 시스템은 그들의 출력에 기반하여 형성된 대부분의 믿음이 참이라고 하더라도 지식의 기초로 기능할 수 없습니다. 이는 그러한 AI 시스템이 역량을 보여주지 못하기 때문입니다.\n프로그램",

    "text": "Abstract:\nThe pragmatism of George Herbert Mead has been fundamental to the sociological understanding of the self. However, the complexity of his work is largely unrecognized in the discipline. This mainly affects the way Mead intertwined discursivity with the materiality of experience in his conception of human subjectivity. Through a metatheoretical analysis, the present paper proposes a straightforward approximation between Mead’s theories of the self and the act in order to contemplate the incidence of processes encompassed by the latter upon the former. Based on this movement, and after a dialogue with Francis Chateauraynaud’s pragmatic sociology, the paper suggests a new Meadian-inspired sociological alternative to the concept of self, attentive to its material dimension and centered on the concepts of outer and inner grasps. The current discussion about the ontological politics in the context of a new mastery of nature allows for an empirical exercise of the argument.\nKeywords: George Herbert Mead; materiality; self; pragmatic sociology; risk\nIntroduction The prominence enjoyed by the idea of interaction in the theoretical framework of sociology is much indebted to George Herbert Mead’s pragmatist philosophy. His proposal of a socially developed individual self (Mead, 1903, 1910, 1912, 1913, 1922, 1925, 1967 [1934], 2011 [n.d.]) has been taken by different approaches within the sociological discipline as an axis for the solution of the polarization between structure and agency. The communicative properties of interaction, which stand out in his discussions on social psychology, have been pivotal in this aspect. However, sociology has underexplored the fact that neither interaction nor the self are restricted to such properties in Mead’s work.\nAlthough not focused directly or systematically on the topic of the self, his theory of the act and his general discussion on the human perception of physical objects (Mead, 1912, 1926, 1932, 2011 [n.d.], especially 1972 [1938]), suggest that the material dimension of experience is elementary for the self’s constitution and performance. The overall goal of the present article is of metatheoretical nature, namely, to develop a Meadian-inspired sociological alternative to the concept of self which is not limited to its internal and external symbolic transactions, but which is also attentive to the material groundings of such interactions.\nThe first section of the text sets the problem of the sociological undervaluation of Mead’s concern with the material properties of the self. I analyze the form in which three specific authors, Herbert Blumer, Jürgen Habermas and Axel Honneth were central for the reduction of Mead’s complexity to his proposition of symbolically mediated intersubjectivity as the pillar of the dynamics of socialization. A fourth scholar, Hans Joas, partially departs from the problem, but still joins the others in a limiting view on the internal composition of the self which, due to the wide reach of their readings of Mead, became hegemonic in the social sciences. A counter-hegemonic understanding of the inner structure of the self is addressed in the following section, which presents an internal reconstruction of Mead that straightforwardly brings together his theories of the self and the act. It addresses the issue of materiality in the Meadian act based on Markell’s reading of the concepts of “I” and “me” (Markell, 2007) and puts into dialogue three different faces of Mead, which are not systematized in his own work due to its fragmented characteristic: the Jamesian, Deweyan and Whiteheadian ones. The purpose behind this move is to seek in Mead’s own conceptual edifice the foundation for a conception of the self where the materiality of experience plays active role in the construction of subjectivity.\nThe third and last section sets off seeking to empirically ground the previous conceptual work. The social sciences have recently faced epistemological challenges set by technological advancements in ventures such as biotechnology and geoengineering, which promote what Pellizzoni (2015) has named the new mastery of nature. Based on new forms of structural intervention in matter, these new technologies increasingly guide considerations about the relations between nature, capitalism and risk towards an ontological dimension of analysis. They also set the stage for renewed reflections on the intersection between the material contact with the world and the production of subjectivity within contemporary modernity. Accordingly, I draw upon the aforementioned metatheoretical endeavor in order to tackle the vicissitudes of this new historical formation. My starting point for this task lies in considering that Mead’s pragmatism is as important to detail the engine moving the political ontology of this new relationship with nature as it is to build an inquiry critique based on practical consequences as the most adequate criterion for judgement. In a decisive point of this last section I signal the need for a sociological interlocutor able to back up Mead’s material concerns, suggesting Francis Chateauraynaud’s pragmatic sociology, and specifically his discussion around the concept of grasps (prises), as fit for this purpose. I then settle my argument with a Meadian rendering of Chateauraynaud, advancing the idea of the individual self as composed by inner and outer grasps. By taking such a step, on the one hand, the operationalization of elements such as conflict, asymmetry and domination in Mead is enabled, whereas, on the other hand, Chateauraynaud’s sociology benefits from a valuable input for the construction of a pragmatics of interiority.\n\nThe neglect of Mead’s ecological view of the self in social theory and the hegemonic interpretation of the “I” and the “me” Not a sociologist himself, Mead’s incorporation into the discipline often relied on the mediation of authors directly affiliated to sociology or with a wide margin of influence over its academic field. Throughout the 20th century, symbolic interactionism and critical theory provided decisive entry points for the “sociologization” of Mead, imprinting their marks on the form which sociologists absorbed his concepts (Silva, 2007; Huebner, 2014).\n\nIn this section I draw a critical appraisal of four interpretations of Mead made by different authors: Herbert Blumer (symbolic interactionism), Jürgen Habermas and Axel Honneth (critical theory) and Hans Joas (linked to both critical theory and Chicago’s sociological tradition). Notwithstanding notable differences among them, the first three authors converge on what can be deemed as a problematic understanding of Mead’s conception of self, which has as one of its outcomes the omission of the importance of materiality in his pragmatism.\nJoas, on the other hand, hints at the direction for the solution of this problem, but does not follow the path to the end, since he stands by the same limiting understanding of the Meadian concepts of “I” and “me” as that of the other three authors.\nIt is worth discussing briefly some of the most substantial elements of Mead’s thought about the social construction of the self and its communicative properties in order to understand the role the aforementioned authors reserve for him in their own respective works. By assuming an anti-Cartesian position, Mead does not consider the self as an anthropological starting point but conceives it as the outcome of ecologically contextualized communicative processes that evolve both phylogenetically and ontogenetically. Two influences are central to him in this assertion: the integrating view that, by late 19th century, Dewey (1896) launched over the concepts of stimulus and response in perception and the relevance proposed by Wundt of the interchange of gestures as a foundational factor of language (Mead, 1903, 1910, 1922)1. Mead locates the origins of the self in the conversation of gestures among two or more individuals belonging to a given species in the animal world.\nSuch conversation sets stimuli and response circuits that coordinate the succession of acts in the behavior of those individuals. The distinctive feature of the conversation of gestures in human species lies on its qualitative remark supported by the development of a reflective intelligence, or reflective conscience, capable of giving meaning to the expression of attitudes through significant symbols (Mead, 1910: 178, 1922: 161, 1967 [1934]: 45ff, 90- 100). A gesture brings along a significant symbol “[…] when it has the same effect on the individual making it that it has on the individual to whom it is addressed, or who explicitly responds to it […]” (Mead, 1967 [1934]: 46), whereas the origins of meaning lie on concrete interactions throughout the course of communicative experiences among individuals, when they mutually alter their responses by taking a specific goal as reference and reach a substantial degree of symbolic unity (Mead, 1967 [1934]: pp.77-80).\nOne of the most relevant consequences Mead extracts from his idea of reflective intelligence is that a gesture imprinted by an individual towards a companion of action, in other words, a stimulus to the other’s response, already carries along the projective anticipation of such a response, so that the uttering individual is also stimulated by its own gesture. The extension of this dynamics opens room for the continuous process of reciprocal 1 In regard to Mead’s intellectual relations with Dewey, it is correct to say they both influenced each other throughout their careers.\nmodification of gestures that structures the collective coordination of behaviors. By acting this way, the individual continuously relies upon the attitudes that others address towards it in order to become an object for oneself. In its turn, this subjective movement implies that the individual also acts as the very subject of oneself by rebuilding its position within the social act in a manner attuned to information provided by the world around to it (Mead, 1913: 379-380, 1922: 160, 1925: 267, 1967 [1934]: 135ff). We can observe, at this point, the socialized nature of the self. It is constituted as a psychosocial structure with interactive characteristics that expresses itself as an inner conversation, or forum, where both its subjective and objective aspects take part in. It encompasses reminiscences acquired by the individual actor through the environments it has experienced and the people it has lived and communicated with, directly or indirectly, throughout its life. These elements work out as raw material for the construction of this actor’s own individuality.\nMead’s social-psychological outline sketched above was taken by Blumer as the main pillar of his symbolic interactionist approach. Blumer (1969) relies on Mead’s discussion of the relation between mind, reflective intelligence and the significant symbol in order to suggest that society might be seen as comprised by the interlinkage of symbolic and non-symbolic interactions among individuals, and that sociology’s main task is to develop its analytical work specifically focused on the former. This is so because, in his view, Mead’s major legacy to sociology would be to portray society as constructed characteristically out of the conscious organization of meanings found in the intersubjective relations of a plurality of selves. For Blumer (1969: 23ff), therefore, “the obdurate character of the empirical world” that repeatedly challenges the rigid models of the sociologist is marked by the contingency and fluidity of the interchange of meanings that forms the core of people’s social experiences.\nSymbolic interactionism turned out to be a richly diversified sociological current, unrestricted to Blumer’s own ideas and with different degrees of proximity to Mead’s philosophy depending on each author (Joas, 1993: ch.1). However, it is notorious that over the years Blumer acted not as an ordinary epigone, but as heir apparent and legitimate interpreter of Mead, adapting his philosophical work to the language and empirical methodology of sociology. His particular approach was key for the reception of Meadian concepts in the American social sciences (Huebner, 2014: 158ff).\nAlthough critical theory’s first generation was quite skeptical about the validity of American pragmatism (Joas, 1993: ch.4), Mead’s social psychology was of great importance to the theoretical synthesis developed by Habermas, one of the leading figures of Frankfurt School’s second generation. Habermas found in Mead’s theoretical framework elements he believed were capable of restituting the emancipatory potential of the concept of reason within the universe of the German critique, since the pragmatist’s decentralized conception of conscience allowed him to wander about a consensual social dynamics based on cognitively and normatively justified actions. The Meadian concept of the generalized other was essential for Habermas to locate the construction of legitimacy within the communicative practices of the phenomenological concept of the lifeworld. In Mead’s work (1922: 161ff, 1925: 268ff, 1932: 87, 1967 [1934]: 154), the generalized other refers to the internalization of the structural organization of the attitudes of community by the individual.\nAkin to Blumer, but with structural inclinations, Habermas (1987 [1985]: 37-44) sees in this set of roles and expectations the key point of the production of norms, notwithstanding his conclusion that Mead, in his own work, shied away from a satisfactory solution to the problem of institutions.\nMead’s ideas are also an important reference for the architecture of Axel Honneth’s theory of recognition, which sought a new reformulation of Frankfurt’s critical tradition by introducing social conflict as the driving force of historical transformation. Honneth saw in the struggle for recognition the collectivized instance of the inner tensions of Mead’s self, the ones deriving from conversations or discussions between its two phases. In a very general way (to be further worked out shortly) we may define the“I” as the element which corresponds to the self’s subjective facet and the “me” as the one which is correlated to its objective facet (Mead, 1912, 1913, 1925, 1967 [1934], 2011 [n.d.]). According to Honneth’s reasoning (Honneth, 2002: 502), by taking the reciprocity of recognition “[…] as the individual evolution of a ‘me’ that consists in the consciousness of legitimate social expectations, then the ‘I’ could perhaps be conceptualized as the source of continuous rebellion against established forms of recognition […]”. By resorting to Mead, Honneth (1995 [1992]: 84-85) saw an opportunity to fill the motivational gap in Hegel’s theory of recognition. The “I” would be a force behind demands for the extension of society’s structures of recognition in favor of causes hitherto not incorporated by them, since it would be a source of irradiation of individuals’ creativity that stands up to the conventionality of the “me”.\nWhat has been discussed so far allows the realization that the form through which Blumer, Habermas and Honneth imported Mead’s thought does not make justice to it, since they access his discussion on the self from only one of the angles available in his work, namely: a social psychology concerned with the symbolic properties of the formation of consciousness and communication. Hans Joas, another student of Habermas trained in the Frankfurtian lineage, but who also established strong bonds to the Chicago tradition, shined light on some consequences of this limited view of Mead’s thought. According to Joas (1993: 137), Habermas’ restriction (also observed in Blumer and Honneth) of the Meadian conception of social interaction at gestural language level is a “misunderstanding” that would, furthermore, explain the assessment that a satisfactory discussion about the institutionalized social order is absent in Mead. Not only would that be untrue (given Mead’s concerns about democracy and science - Joas, 1993: 137, also see 1985 [1980]: ch.9; Silva, 2008), but the same interpretation puts aside other extremely important objects of Mead’s philosophy.\nAs suggested by Joas (1985 [1980]: 145ff), there was never a border in Mead’s writings between a world of action exclusively inhabited by humans and a world of non- human beings and inanimate objects fully excluded from linguistic exchanges. For the pragmatist philosopher, subjectivity and the production of meaning take place in complex milieus where human behavior is engaged with entities of plural constitutions. This feature evidences Mead’s connection to the strong naturalist profile spread over the pragmatist environment of Chicago during the passage from the 19th to the 20th century (Dewey et al, 1945; Cefaï, 2001). Reflecting on the ethical implications of this environmental characteristic of Mead, Brewster and Puddephatt (2016: 155) claim that his would be an “ecological view of the self”, which becomes “[…] more expansive both by being progressively more inclusive of diverse others [i.e. human and non-human] into our existing groups and communities and by progressively identifying with larger groups and communities […]”.\nBy stripping Brewster and Puddephatt’s proposition of its moral aspect (however relevant this is) we observe that an ecological view of the self also holds ontological and cognitive grounds in Mead’s thought. We may return to Joas (1985 [1980]: 159-161) for a relevant entry point to this argument when he recalls that, in Mead’s theory of the act (1932: 119-139, 1972 [1938], 2011 [n.d.]) the construction of the physical object by a perceptive subject is socially mediated and linked to the apprehension of the unity of the subject’s own body as the likely object of its action. However, Joas (1996: 181-184) does not move forward in order to in-depth explore the questions this observation brings over the constitution and maintenance of the self, and rather remains bound to the discussion about the link between creativity and the formation of body image. By thinking both with and against Joas I argue that, if a truly ecological treatment to the self should not be limited to linguistic interchanges that substantiate human intersubjectivity, it must also not be narrowed down to the mere valuing of corporeal elements linked to the interactive experiences of individuals. It is essential investing in an integrative view between both aspects, so we may contemplate the inseparability of the material and symbolic dimensions in the continuous counterpoint between subjectivity and objectivity in the inner domains of each individual.\nIn addition to the point highlighted by Joas about Habermas, which is extensible to Blumer and Honneth, there are two deficiencies related to the form of appropriation of Mead which can be claimed common to all these four authors. The first one regards the conceptual selection they carried out in Mead’s work in order to integrate sections of it to their own respective synthesis. The absence of the notions of problem and inquiry (both central to pragmatism) in each of those four conceptual cores separates the theoretical analysis of the self from the practical context of its formation, as well as from the (re)constructive work of reflective intelligence in the course of continuous displacements between the worlds of matter and meaning. I shall explore the relevance of this pair of concepts for the reconstruction of Mead herein envisaged later (section two) in this article.\nFor now I will focus on the second common deficiency of the appropriation of Mead by the authors discussed in the current topic, which rests on the interpretative alternative that they followed regarding the inner structure of the self. It is implicit in Joas’ formulation that the maximum participation of materialility within the self occurs when the material world itself is taken as object for the self’s action during the process of consolidation of the bodily unity. Such a lack of consideration with the active role of materiality in human action and subjectivity results from the interpretation of relations between the Meadian concepts of “I” and “me” that was sanctioned by Joas and shared with Blumer, Habermas and Honneth. Both the American and the German authors welcomed into their respective theoretical works a problematic definition which largely reduces the “I” to individual and the “me” to collective personifications within the self.\nThis specific approach to the roles of the “I” and the “me” in Mead’s self has been called into question by Markell (2007) in the wake of a critique to what he understands as a disabling feature of Honneth’s theory of recognition. The main line of his argument (Markell, 2007: 102-107) lies on the proposition that the definition of recognition as necessary crossing point for the transformation of personhood from something potential to actual means the submission of its self-realization to an external authority. According to Markell (2007: 112- 114, 125-128), this problem derives from the reifying reading of the “I” and the “me” that Honneth made of Mead . Such an approach defines these two concepts as clearly different and counterposed agencies. On the one hand, the “I” would encompass an irreducible individuality, with nature similar to the unconsciousness of psychoanalysis and whose contingency and creativity would represent the potential of renovation. On the other hand, the “me” would be formed by a collective force, a habitual agent that is transposed from the community to the individual in order to censor its “I”. Honneth would not be alone in this interpretation of the Meadian self, for both Habermas and Joas would share with him the idea that the “I” is “[…] something like a source or seat within the individual of creativity, novelty, spontaneity, or resistance to social norms.” (Markell, 2007: 112-113, emphasis in original)2.\nAs pointed out before, Blumer’s understanding on the matter is not distant to that of the Frankfurtians. While acknowledging an ambiguity in the form Mead used the two terms, the sociologist sees the “I” as that thing that brings into the self “[…] expression and release to organic impulse and tendency […]” and the “me” as something that “[…] reflects the attitude of the community […]” (Blumer, 2004: 65-66).\nFor the purposes of the present discussion, the main problem with relating the “I” and the “me” in this way is that it compromises the linkage between Mead’s social psychology and his reflections on perception and the human engagement with matter present in his theory of the act. The delimitation of the self to a symbolically mediated dialogue between a radically individual agency and an interiorized force representing society (in its minimal definition of a collective of individuals) rules out the incidence of the material dimension of human experience on the production of subjectivity. If, as stated by Mead (2011 [n.d.]: 27), “the relations of the environment and the individuals is one of mutual influence.”, 2 Markell (2007: 112) recalls that for Habermas (1992: 180) “[…] the “I” appears on the one hand as the pressure of presocial, natural drives, and on the other hand as the impulse of creative fantasy […]” while for Joas (1985 [1980]: 118) it represents “[…] the endowment of the human being with impulses.”. Despite not identifying such impulses with “[…] some natural compulsion […]”, Joas (1985 [1980]: 118) sees them as unceasing individual drives, finding “[…] expression in fantasies […]”.\nit is necessary to recognize that the interpersonal relations of the self traverse and are traversed by constellations of physical entities. The expansion of the ecological view of Mead’s concept of self can contribute to a more complex and environmentally promising version of his idea of subjectivity.\n\nThe materiality of the “I” at the confluence of self and act 2.1. – Actuality, materiality and the “I” Blumer’s observation about the ambiguity of Mead’s utilization of the “I” and the “me” in his own discussion on the self should not be overlooked. In fact, the problematic understanding of the two concepts portrayed in the last section does not lay roots either in symbolic interactionism or critical theory’s incorporation of Mead, but in Mead’s own writings, on the polyphony he adopted to treat both concepts along his career. There are basically two forms which Mead dealt with the dynamics of the “I” and the “me”. Later in his work, the idea of counterposed individual and social agencies within the self predominates.\n\nThis version has prevailed in his canonization in sociology and sustains the hegemonic interpretation of the Meadian self, as we have seen in the previous section. But another interpretation of the conceptual pair, more aligned with the pragmatism of James and Dewey, finds substance in Mead’s early discussions on the self (Mead: 1903, 1912, 1913)3. It is the intent of the present section to show that this alternative, counter-hegemonic interpretation of the “I” and “me” dynamics is more suitable for dealing with the material properties of subjectivity and, therefore, to serve as starting point for a sociological reconstruction of Mead concerned with an ecological conception of the self.\nSome years ago, Markell (2007) took a stance adopted later by other authors (Silva, 2007: 106-107; Cook, 2013) and set forth a diligent rescue of Mead’s earlier conception of the “I” and the “me”. More specifically, Markell has reclaimed Meads’ articulation (1903: 101- 102) between the original Jamesian formulation of the self, which is constituted by the pure 3 Mead clearly adheres to this approach in texts such as The Definition of the Psychical, The Mechanism of Social Consciousness and The Social Self, all published during the two first decades of the 20th century. In Mind, Self & Society, which is composed mainly of notes taken from Mead’s lectures in Chicago during 1928, the two interpretations of the “I” and the “me” contents coexist. Markell (2007) and Cook (2013) explore the contrast between them in detail.\nego (“I”) and the empirical self (“me”), and the proposition by Dewey (1896: 364) that stimulus and response do not have separate and empirically definable contents, since they are rather referentially composed and only distinguishable through the function they fulfill in the coordination of the sensory-motor circuit.\nIn this specific formulation, Mead concludes that the self is a continuous encounter, in the flow of the individual’s experiences, between subjectivity and objectivity as phases, i.e. aspects4, of its understanding about the world and about itself. The self’s interaction with the rest of the individuals’ internal and external experience field is particularly dynamic in situations when uncertainties break that flow and disrupt the constitution of the object of action, a process which Dewey has called “disintegration” (Mead, 1903: 101). Within this individual innerscape, the subjective aspect of the self is given by the “I”, the “[…] reconstructive activity […]” (Mead, 1903: 109, emphasis added) responsible for the emergence of new objects in action, which takes place in the “[…] very process of replying to one’s own talk [… through] the gestures, the symbols, that arise in consciousness” (Mead, 1912: 406, emphasis added). Based on such a conception, the “I” is configured as the transitive element of the “stream of consciousness” that links different objective experiences and gives them a singularizing touch, a particular inward coloring that confers to the individual a sense of existential continuity (James, 1955 [1890]: 159). Therefore, the “I” is responsible for the subjective synthesis between an individual’s reflections and feelings by generating a sense of unity and sameness that supports its personal identity (James, 1955 [1890]: 214-216). The “me”, in its turn, emerges as the objective aspect of the self, which delimits, within this field of experience, the elements that can be (re)constructed as objects to the individuals’ action through its assumption of the attitudes of others with reference to oneself. Briefly, the “I” is the activity, the “actual response”, which is provided by the self to a problem caused by the disruption of an object (Mead, 1967 [1934]: 277); the “me” is the objectivity of experience introduced to the self when it assumes the attitudes of others (Mead, 1967 [1934]: 175, also see Markell, 2007: 125-127).\nIt is important to distinguish Markell’s distancing from the hegemonic interpretation of the internal structure of Mead’s self from the approach offered by Lewis (1979). Like Markell, Lewis also opposes the assumption that the “I” is an organically composed portion of the self with entity-like properties and, conversely, treats it as the self’s 4 Based on the Meadian vocabulary, the word “phase” does not necessarily regard a stage belonging to some sequential teleological order. Its use is not different from that of the word “aspect” (Silva, 2008: 90-91).\nform of response in communication. However, seeking what he calls a “social behaviorist” approach of the self, Lewis points out that the “I” is the predominantly overt response, the “[…] observable activity which is attended to by both the self and the other.” (Lewis, 1979: 269). He then offers an objectivist version of the “I” by basically excluding its presence in thought and by wiping out the subjective core of intimacy envisioned by Mead’s early writings from its response.\nWith traces of Dewey, one of the main effects of this counter-hegemonic understanding about the inner structure of the self lies on the fact that only the roles played by “I” and “me” can be respectively identified through exclusively individual and social properties; their content, however, is interchangeable (Markell, 2007: 128; Cook, 2013: 121- 124). As suggested by Markell (2007: 128), Mead’s assertion that the reconstructive activity of a present “I” ends up, retrospectively, integrating the objectivity of a future “me” (Mead, 1913: 374, 1967 [1934]: 174) also works in reverse. From this reasoning we conclude that the adoption of the attitude of the other by the individual as its response derives from a form of exercise, rather than necessarily from a drawback, of its individuality. The very act of responding, whether with or against society, is a manifestation of the “I”. Consequently, the same image or representation crossing one of the components of the “I”-“me” pair may come to attend the other. The only variation in those elements will be observed in the type of their functional participation in this reconstructive inner move, whether stimulus or response.\nThis approach is essential for us to understand the material dimension of the self. In order to advance in this direction, it must be specified that, due to the social treatment Mead gives to ontogenetic development, he sees the initial contact with the material world as the consolidation of the intersubjective cognitive mechanism in the individual. The physical object is the abstraction of the social object (Mead, 1972 [1938]: 190). Therefore, the physical thing always enters the experience of a person through the resistance awakened by the friction between that thing and the person’s physical organism. This resistance allows the identification of something substantial in the object, which is not necessarily a personality, but an interior, an “inside” that gives physical responses (thickness, roughness, rigidity…) to the frictional stimulus that, in its turn, is transported to the self and assumed by it through the objectivity of the “me” (Mead, 1972 [1938]: 109-110, 143-144, 152, 186-187, 191-196, 212- 213, 429-431). Devoid of communicative capacity, the resistance provided by the physical object to the human body is the equivalent to its voice in the Meadian interactive structure, so that we talk with things through their ledges, crests, and folds. Resistance also implies cooperation (Mead, 1972 [1938]: pp.108-110). Therefore, by drawing upon a vocabulary influenced by contemporary pragmatic sociology, I can state that, in affinity with Mead, the self is not only buttressed by conventional supports of action (Dodier, 1993), but also by material supports that are brought to its inner realm in the course of its interactions in a world full of physical objects.\nOnce inside the individual’s inner constitution, sensations caused by material supports interact with the universe of language and stir up representations and images stocked in a repertoire of memories built from past experiences: “The image, functionally defined, is then a content that, in terms of past experience, has served as a solution of the problem set in the form of the sensation” (Mead, 1904: 605, also see 1912). By standing before the ecological composition of the problem it faces and the updated version of its self (which is likely the carrier of a new, previously absent, memory), the individual’s response (which exercises the singularity of its “I”) can give rise to new images, i.e., new symbolic interpretations of those materially experienced sensations. My point in here does not lie on the precedence of materiality’s magnitude in comparison to the symbolic dimension of Mead’s pragmatism. I rather shine light on the way Mead is sensible to the reciprocity between the material and the symbolic. Significant symbols and physical resistances meet each other through the communicative work of thought, so that symbols find ballast in material supports and physical resistances acquire meaning from conventional references.\nThe discussion indicates that creative action benefits, on the one hand, from the situational variability set by the flux of experiences and, on the other, from the reconstructive work of the “I”-response, which expresses the individual’s volitions and goals in the space between an old reality that became obsolete, and a new reality yet to be defined (Mead, 1972 [1938]: 34-35, 115). By associating the “I” and the “me” with the creativity found in the resolution of problems set by interactions between people and things, we get to the vertex between the theories of self and the act.\nA few systematic words about the act are relevant at this point. Its substantial elaboration is found on The Philosophy of the Act, which is a posthumous compilation composed of writings where Mead was under the advanced influence of Alfred North Whitehead’s objective relativism. The act is an activity of practical ontology wherein human beings socially set the sense of reality by means of the convergence between their signifying abilities and the material properties of the natural world throughout a spatiotemporal axis.\nMead analytically distinguishes the act into four phases: 1) impulse, when sensations experienced by the individual start the first levels of the construction of a response that lasts the whole trajectory of the act; 2) perception, when, at distance, the object occupying the center of the act starts to be outlined after being associated with that initial sensation; 3) manipulation, when distance gives way to contact and a conscious analysis is exerted over the object; 4) consummation, when the construction of response is concluded and brings along a qualification cast upon the object (Mead, 1972 [1938]: ch.1).\nThe different stages of the act encompass the previously mentioned concepts of problem and inquiry. By drawing upon Dewey’s idea about the disintegration of the object, Mead (1972 [1938]: p.6) defines the problem as the “[…] lack of adjustment between the individual and his world”. It occurs in the context of the act due to the development of the incompatibility between the response provided by the individual and the demands it deals with after receiving a given stimulus. This situational mismatch breaks the flow of the act.\nThe reconstructive work that starts at this point follows the inquiry form, which experimentally analyzes data about the problematic situation in order to reduce incongruous or ambiguous information, to formulate new hypotheses for the solution of the problem, and to test such hypotheses by checking whether the paused act has been restored, or not (Mead, 1972 [1938]: 82-83; also see Cook, 1993: 177).\nA displacement occurs within two gradients throughout this inquiry. The first gradient is related to spatiotemporal proximity, as the examination of an object, whose initial stimuli are always felt at distance, depends on direct contact with the inquirer for effective experimentation. The second one concerns cognitive formality, as individuals move from a spontaneous relationship with the world around them, which Meads calls immediate experience, to the rationalized attitude of a reflected analysis, when conscience is already oriented towards the manipulation phase in order to experimentally test the components of the problem at hand (Mead, 1932: 133-139, 1972 [1938]: 13-16).\nThese two movements influence the inner configuration of the inquirer’s self as it goes through different situations. The objective stimulation (“me”) and the response (“I”) are gradually defined throughout the double displacement caused by the inquiry in the course of the act, from its initial stage (when immediate experience prevails) to the full establishment of reflected analysis (which takes place in manipulation). When reflected analysis is accessed, self-consciousness and awareness about objects adjacent to the self, which are based on a rationalized form of problem appreciation, are quite well-focused. At phylogenetic level, obtainment of rational problem solving does not result from the rupture with a state prior to conscience, but unfolds from it, in a dependent fashion, following the emergence of the significant symbol (Mead, 1922: 160, 1925: 271, 1967 [1934]: 68-82; Silva, 2008: 121-122). When it comes to the individual level, the theory of the act suggests that, as soon as the basis of one’s self is formed, the expression of the analytical reflection about an object in the field of experiences is situational and progressive, so that there is no interruption in thought, but continuity between rationality and the most intuitive forms of engaging in the world. Thus, we observe that the reconstruction of external data sets the “I” and the “me” in motion, and that this process will reflect on the interior domain of the self.\nThe self as inquirer also reconstructs its own inner constitution through its relations with the objects around it.\n2.2. Perspectives and prehensions In the transactions with the world sketched above the individual only has access to the common ground of reality through its own perspective. The idea of perspective has noteworthy presence in the work developed by Mead in the last decade of his life. Its mobilization represents Mead’s attempt to combine his pragmatist naturalism to the relational metaphysics of Whitehead (Mead, 1925: 259-260, 1932: 161-163). In a quite concise fashion, a perspective can be defined as the product of perception spatiotemporally originated from a percipient event that finds itself in relation to a consentient set, i.e., an environment comprising relevant objects concerning the existence of that perceiving entity (Mead, 1925: 256, 1932: 161-175, 1972 [1938]: 100ff). Different perspectives developed throughout the act are concentrated either in a prospective unity, as the promise of a future trajectory, or in a retrospective manner, in the consummation phase, when the act acquires evaluative character (Mead, 1934: 162, 1972 [1938]: 134). After all, reality is the product of a relational organization of perspectives, and individual human subjectivity is part of nature’s objectivity because it is a concrete datum produced within the interchange of organism and environment (Mead, 1972 [1938]: 163).\nMead’s borrowing of the concept of perspective is essential for the present articulation of his theories of self and act. As we know, the philosopher points out that the self benefits from inquiries conducted by the individual on its own inner affairs and problems, which are intersubjectively developed throughout relations with the external environment (Mead, 1913: 378-379, 1967 [1934]: 38, 97-100, 119-124, 177, 188, 216, 254, 274-281, 308, 376, 1972 [1938]: ch.1, 5). Conversations internal to the self sustain thought as a reconstructive activity enabling the individual to set up the self-perspective that defines its singularity (Mead, 1967 [1934]: 254, 308). Thus, Mead (1925: 259-260) understands that “[…] each individual has a world that differs in some degree from that of any other member of the same community, [and] that he slices the events of the community life that are common to all from a different angle from that of any other individual.”. The angles provided by the perspectives of each percipient event produce a stratified reality that comprises nature itself (Mead, 1932: 171).\nBy taking part in continuous processes of relational entanglement of viewpoints that comprise nature, the self has to deal with the material dimension of perspectives from a whole set of entities it interacts with in space and time. The articulation between the concepts of perspective and prehension in Whitehead’s philosophy helps us better understanding materiality’s relevance for the internal construction of individuality in Mead’s work.\nAccording to Whitehead (2011 [1925]): 86, 1978: 18ff), prehension is a mode of perception that takes shape through apprehension, whether cognitive or not, of a given actual entity over another. We do not find in it a simple extension of a being over another, or even an aggregate formed by the sum of two, or more, entities. In the formation of a prehensive unity, Whitehead (2011 [1925]): 81) sees the transperspective complexity of reality with the interpenetration of aspects among all beings composing a totality. Yet, due to its “vector character” (Whitehead, 1978: 19-20), prehension is the form through which an entity can extend itself to others, involve and be involved by them and express its singularity to the external environment. In short, there is no individuality without interdependence between the different perspectives observed in the same universe.\nIn Mead’s work, aside brief mentions in The Philosophy of the Act (1972 [1938]: 147, 202), there is a relevant reference to the concept of prehension in his essay The Objective Reality of Perspectives, published originally in 1926 and later compiled in The Philosophy of the Present. In such reference, Mead makes it clear that, from his view, the way how individuals deal with the common environment cannot be separated from the perspectives they built over themselves within their inner scopes: The consentient set is determined by its relation to a percipient event or organism. The percipient event establishes a lasting character of here and there, of now and then, and is itself an enduring pattern. The pattern repeats itself in the passage of events.\nThese recurrent patterns are grasped together or prehended into a unity, which must have as great a temporal spread as the organism requires to be what it is, whether this period is found in the revolutions of the electrons in an iron atom or in the specious present of a human being. Such a percipient event or organism establishes a consentient set of patterns of events that endure in the relations of here and there, of now and then, through such periods or essential epochs, constituting thus slabs of nature, and differentiating space from time. This perspective of the organism is then there in nature. (Mead, 1932: 162, emphasis added) Because it is a perceptual apprehension that is not reduced to cognitive intercourses between entities, prehension immediately refers us to processes of contact present in the flow of Mead’s act, from the impulse phase to the consummation phase. However, the excerpt above indicates that, according to Mead, by apprehending objects through such a process, a subject is simultaneously setting in motion the prehensive unit of its own self. This unity is built through the interaction of the individual with its consentient set, as different response patterns (elaborated in the interaction between “I” and “me” and later translated into a new mnemonically reconfigured “me”) are temporally accumulated and “grasped together or prehended” as the continuity of its being. This takes us back to James’ influence upon Mead’s initial phase, in particular to the proposition of personal identity as the subjective synthesis of experiences. By dialoguing with this reference it is possible to see in the context of interior problematic situations the “I” and the “me” engaging in a process of inner prehension, in which each of the two elements strives to seize the other from their own perspective, the result of this transaction being the personal configuration of the self. This means that the self derives from the crossing of perspectives between subjectivity and objectivity in the context of mind, where the “I” and the “me” seek to grasp one another 5.\nBy looking at this topic through such lenses, excerpts where Mead states that “The active individual [the “I”] finds in this object individual [the “me”] and its world the conditions under which its action may take place” (2011 [n.d.]: 31, emphasis added) can be interpreted as indicating the possibility that material supports from the field of experiences contribute to the consolidation of the posture of the “I”-response in the temporal flow, not 5 The conception of “I” and “me” as perspectives is also present in Bolton (1981). However, while I follow Whitehead’s definition of the concept, Bolton (1981: 249) suggests a simplified version of perspective as “[…] a symbolically organized mode of orienting oneself toward a situation […]”.\nonly to the configuration of a “me” an organic and naturally individual “I” presents itself to.\nIf, as suggested by Markell, the subjective self encompasses in its transitivity the generalized social attitudes brought along by the objective self, it does the same thing with the material impressions left by contact with physical objects. Matter is not simply an input that passively receives directions from the individuality of the self; it effectively acts upon this individuality, by influencing it through the game played between resistance and cooperation, which is especially observed in manipulation. The transitive state of the stream of consciousness composing the “I” can be supported either by the representational, imagistic and normative conventions of social relations or by the physical contours of the world in order to give its touch of singularity to the self. We seek and take hold of the perspective of an object, prehending its “inside”, just as we seek and take hold of the other in social conduct during the making of our own behavior. The ledges of things are as important for the definition of the response of the “I” in the subjective conformation of our actions as the social expectations of our human peers: “By acting as the object will act […]” says Mead, “[…] we realize the hardness of the object and do not run our heads against it.” (1972 [1938]: 107). We conclude that matter takes part not only in the formation of an individual’s corporal self-image, as Joas points out, but also in the entire introspective process of problem solving that feeds its self- understanding. As Mead himself has stated (1926: 382), that object we lay our hands over is turned into a material to build the world of our heart’s desire and dreams.\nThe interpretation built throughout this section made Markell’s rescue of the pioneer version of “I” and “me” meet Mead’s Whiteheadian reflections, and from there extracted the newly proposed approach of the material supports of the self. In important points, it contrasts with the view defended by Rosenthal and Bourgeois (1991). These authors have accessed Mead’s work by making the effort to make him closer to Merleau- Ponty (Rosenthal and Bourgeois, 1991: 103ff). In their theoretical convergence, they do not adhere to the counter-hegemonic definition of the “I” and “me” concepts, and it leads them to two important mistakes. Firstly, according to Rosenthal and Bourgeois, “I” and “me” do not fully take part in the reconstructive process of the problematic experience, because the disintegration of the object would also cause the transitory disintegration of the relationship between these two components of the self. During the first moments of reconstruction, the individual would only count on the fundamental subjectivity of the “concrete subject” and on its “lived body” (Rosenthal and Bourgeois, 1991: 106), notions taken by the pair of authors from Merleau-Ponty as sources of bodily intelligence. Secondly, because Rosenthal and Bourgeois do not assume the “I” as intrinsically associated with the response activity, they do not see the complex, continuous and incremental relationship between its role in the structure of the self and the material supports of action. According to them, “I” and “me” only return to the scene after the establishment of conscious reflection, and in there they are added to the dynamics of the concrete subject, which lasts and mediates the interactions of the self with the environment. The continuity of the concrete subject within the self is what would guarantee its exchange with the physical world in a process taking place through a non-thematic internal dialogue wherein the “I” would be experienced, felt as the background of mind, but not made explicit as an object of knowledge (Rosenthal and Bourgeois, 1991:113, 115).\nThis last proposition about a non-rationalized instance in thought actively contributes to the procedural treatment of the Meadian self, which has been designed throughout this paper. Nevertheless, it is worth inquiring: is the deviation through Merleau- Ponty necessary in order to achieve it? My answer is no, and its elaboration helps correcting the two aforementioned problems regarding Rosenthal and Bourgeois’ approach. If we recall the image of the self moving along a gradient of cognitive formality, we observe that the “I” and the “me” are involved in the reconstructive process from its very beginning, when immediate experience prevails. It is at that very moment that both elements express themselves in a non-thematic (following Rosenthal and Bougeois’ denomination), non- symbolic (Blumer, 1969: 8) way or, yet, from another viewpoint, in the manner of what Giddens (1984: 44-45) has called practical conscience, which is found in “[…] circumstances in which people pay attention to events going on around them in such a way as to relate their activity to those events” without, however, “thinking” about what they are doing. In reflective analysis, however, our relationship with the objects grows towards transparency and although still not turned into a theme in direct experience, the “I” finds itself in such circumstances able to support more refined ways of response. We can extract from this reasoning that what Rosenthal and Burgeois attempted to describe by resorting to the external notion of concrete subject can be reached within Mead’s own conceptual universe through the articulation between his theories of the self and the act. Therefore, we understand that, similarly to the symbolic dimension, the material dimension of experience is also part of the prehension of human subjectivity in its different degrees of rationality and intentional clarity, and that it is found both in the objectivity of the “me” and in the reconstructive activity of the “I”.\n\nThe self, pragmatic sociology and the new mastery of nature Different currents of contemporary social theory have recently converged to the appreciation of the ontological dimension of interactive partnerships between humans and other beings. References to an ontological politics (Mol, 1999) or to new materialisms (Coole and Frost, 2010), although quite different from each other, share as common orientation the understanding that definitions of reality are productions traversed by conflicts, disputes and effective transformations. The current section argues that Mead’s pragmatism, mainly his theory of the self as herein reconstituted, offers relevant contribution to the discussion about the ontological twist in the forms of power in contemporary modernity. Furthermore, as announced in the introduction, the theoretical exercise developed throughout this article is aimed at an empirically grounded sociological concern which finds fertile soil for research and reflection in discussions about ontological power. Therefore, in addition to discussing the issue through a Meadian outlook, I will also seize the opportunity to explore in the following pages a new sociological alternative to be integrated into Mead’s conceptual perspective.\n\nMy starting point to deal with these ontological issues is the study by Pellizzoni (2015) about recent reconfigurations in the neoliberal mode of mastery over nature, where he expands previous reflections by Cooper (2008) about the entanglement of knowledge, biotechnology and financial capital6. Pellizzoni describes a paradigmatic shift in the political and economic discourses of capitalism beginning in the 1970s. At that time, the sense of a natural limit to growth was progressively replaced by the proposition of the inexhaustibility of opportunities provided by nature. This new discourse appropriates diagnostics about the complexity of the biophysical world resulting from different sectors of the scientific community and from ecological movements to highlight certain features of environmental processes, such as indetermination and instability. It then generalizes these features in positive manner and depicts the unpredictability of environmental systems as a whole set of possibilities, rather than interdictions, for the fulfillment of human designs. The principle of precaution is then neutralized by the ontological reach of purposeful action, since the attitude to be taken towards risk is not its reduction, but the refinement of interventions in the 6 See Pellizzoni (2015: ch.1) for a comprehensive critical appraisal of post-constructivist/anti-humanist approaches to ontological politics, which are not the focus of the current article.\nbiophysical world. The investment in the figure of indetermination in this new form of mastery over nature reinforces the imaginary of plasticity of reality (Papadopoulos, 2011), which is taken to its last consequences by technological fronts such as geoengineering and biotechnology.\nPellizzoni dialogues, at important aspects, with Boltanski and Chiapello’s (1999) idea about a new moral foundation rising from the establishment of neoliberalism. These two authors suggest that capitalism has overcome the crisis of its industrial period by reconfiguring itself through the cooptation of an artistic critique. Present in several political and cultural movements at the late 1960s, this critical modality used to substantiate demands for mobility, adaptability and, most of all, for flexibility. Once the principle of flexibility was integrated as resource in the entrepreneurial world, the critique that used to call for it was disarmed to a large extent. Pellizzoni (2015: 66) himself points out his affinity with this argument; however, I herein further explore this link by assuming his idea of a new mastery of nature as part of the new spirit of capitalism proposed by Boltanski and Chiapello. Thus, the definition of matter as undetermined source of possibilities, broadly flexible and responsive to human projects, seems to result from a surreptitious response from capitalism to critiques coming from both complexity theorists and ecological movements that, since the 1960s, have drawn attention to the irreducibility of nature to the economic, political and epistemological ventures of that regime. Hence, it can be stated that the capitalist reconfiguration promoted by neoliberalism relied not only on moral supports, as Boltanski and Chiapello have suggested. We find in it the articulation between conventional and material supports in the reformulation of a normativity about the relation between human activity and nature.\nThe ideological reorganization that has promoted this flexibilization of nature in the wake of the formation of a new spirit of capitalism brought to light a new object to human experience. As shown by Mead, this is not sustainable without concrete supports. The neutralization of ecological critique did not occur despite the complexity of nature claimed by scientists and activists, but it precisely resulted from its recognition, since it contributed to the perception about the limitations of the typically industrial form of exploration in face of environmental resistances imposed to human manipulation. The adherence to complexity in the neoliberal layout had the double effect of sophistication of economic interference in nature, on the one hand, and the political emptying of critique (at least to some degree) on the other. Therefore, the development of the new technologies mentioned by Pellizzoni, which also include the ones related to carbon markets and human enhancement, did not happen simply throughout projections of pre-elaborated business models over the biophysical world.\nTheir designers engaged in inquiries that sought analytical contact with the profusion of attributes composing the materials in the center of their attention. By manipulating these objects, they intended to reach their interiors, assume their perspectives and, thus, access the complexity of their constitutions. This means that they understood the ideas by authors such as Morin (2008: 5), about the relationship between knowledge and the environment, but they actively sought to neutralize the critical inclination of such theories in favor of elaborating more creative and efficient forms of extracting economic value from nature. In other words, they relied upon the manifold material supports of nature in order to master it.\nAccordingly, material resistance has acted incisively in the perspectives either of critiques of the industrial mastery of nature and of its reformers. However, materiality does not express itself alone in symbolic mediated social relationships. The concept of complexity was the consummatory, representational form with which this resistance was consolidated as object. But, as we have seen, power relations have marked this adjustment of perspectives between the material world and human agencies. Clear asymmetry is established between these perspectives, because, even if the critical interpretation of complexity keeps on operating, its reformulated version as inexhaustible basis of economic exploitation has all the systemic, institutional and moral support of the new spirit of capitalism.\nBefore I tackle the problem of asymmetries, I shall draw new, pragmatist bases for Pellizzoni’s critique to the new mastery of nature. Based on Heidegger, Pellizzoni (2015: 156-157) defends a fundamental split between being and “thinking”, ontology and epistemology, as the source of the singularity of human existence. Consequently, the new technologies approached by his reflection would be worrying not so much due to the results of their activities, but mainly because they would push the leveling between matter and knowledge. From this viewpoint the corruption of the essence of the human as resident of the world is strengthened, and it leads up to an “[…] instrumentalization of everything [natural] as standing-reserve, governed by relations of efficient causality […]” (Pellizzoni, 2015: 153).\nThrough pragmatist lenses, this line of reasoning is not satisfactory. In the first place because, as seen in the discussion about the symbolic and the material in Mead, for pragmatism both knowledge and matter belong to the domain of practice: thinking is itself a way of acting upon the world (Frega, 2006: 39). Secondly, because it reverses the order of construction of critique (MacGilvray, 2004: 104; Frega, 2006), since its justification is based on the non-contemplation of a principle, in this case, the anthropological proposition of discontinuity between humanity and nature. In order to repel this form of idealism, Dewey- inspired pragmatism, to which Mead was affiliated, emphasizes the need for critique to be experimentally constructed. Critical endeavor should be based on assessments of the consequences of a problem, since the very meaning of the critique’s object is dependent upon such consequences for its process of signification (Frega, 2006: 62-65).\nThe consequences of the new technologies must therefore be the aim of critiques directed to the new mastery of nature. Critical constructions should not aim from the beginning at one-size-fits-all considerations (such as Pellizzoni’s), but instead should proceed modestly in a path guided by inquiry work (Chateauraynaud, 2018). The literature on biotechnology and geoengeneering points out some outcomes of such technologies which are relevant for a critical exercise that sticks to practical consequences as the starting point of judgment. Authors from different, albeit critical, theoretical affiliations (Cooper, 2008; Szerszynski et al, 2013; Demeulenaere, 2014; Pellizzoni, 2015), indicate that the progressive transfer of ontological control from ordinary entities (human or not) to the benefit of power systems that create and administer these technologies is one of the most prominent developments set in motion by both strands of innovation. Inspired by Mead and his Whiteheadian moment, by ontological control I mean the capacity an entity has to apprehend its own constitution as a being in relation to its consentient set and, in the case of humans, to actively inquiry and evaluate objects, including one’s self. Intrinsically linked to the regeneration of the market that has emerged after the global crises of the 1970’s, the new mastery of nature propels a gradual colonization of experience by the economy at “[…] the genetic, microbial, and cellular level, so that life becomes, literally, annexed within capitalist processes of accumulation.” (Cooper, 2008: 19).\nHowever, if Mead did not fully disregard the subject of power, it is true that his liberal normativity has limited his view to dialogical forms of conflict resolution (Silva, 2008: ch.15). Regarding this problem, it is essential extending to Mead the observation by MacGilvray (2004: ch.5) about the Hegelian “extrapragmatic roots” of Dewey’s political theory. Similarly to Dewey, Mead understands that the democratic dynamics of collective life is organized by the teleological harmonization of individual orientations, and that it takes place through communicative processes that integrate the multiple selves into their communities. There is insufficient room in his work to the discussion about inequality, violence and domination, which comes about the reduction of autonomous space for the production of perspectives in favor of hegemonic apprehensions.\nThis characteristic of Mead’s thinking emphasizes the difference between his social philosophy and an empirically oriented sociological approach and casts light upon the value of endeavors made by the authors present in the first section of the paper in order to remold the pragmatist’s conceptual force with sociological design7. As we have seen, however, those theoretical constructions suffer from problems which inhibit a satisfactory account of the self according to the ecological view guiding the present study. A final step in the reconstruction of Mead put forward by this article then lies in the task of finding a new base to synthetically house his perspective in the sociological discipline. After ruling out the most prominent options I suggest that a particular approach within contemporary pragmatic sociology, the one advanced by Francis Chataeauraynaud, presents itself as a promising candidate. In addition to his participation in pragmatic sociology’s active claim of classical pragmatism’s legacy in the beginning of the 2000’s (Chateauraynaud, 2004), Chateauraynaud’s theoretical work stands out for highlighting the intertwining between discursivity and materiality in the conduction of inquiries of both ordinary and expert profile.\nIn order to fill the Meadian gap on violence and domination, I shall introduce the concept of ascendancy (emprise) as understood by Chateauraynaud (2015, Chateauraynaud and Debaz, 2017), in the context of his approach to Foucauldian bio-power from the standpoint of pragmatic sociology. What Chateauraynaud defines as ascendancy is an intense form of asymmetry, non-hierarchical, diffused through networks, based on legitimacy and realized by the way of the biasing of actors’ perceptions (Chateauraynaud and Debaz, 2017: 235). An actor gains ascendancy over others by indirectly influencing their behavior, by conquering their “territories of experiences” (Chateauraynaud, 2015: 9), and, finally, by managing the conformation of problems that are elaborated there, as well as the flow of inquiries conducted to solve them. This discussion is substantiated by the concept of grasps (prises) observed throughout Chateauraynaud’s work. By drawing upon it, the author explores the ontoformative power of convergences between representations and material 7 Mead’s image as an armchair philosopher is not accurate, for he was not entirely distant from empirical practice (Huebner, 2014: ch.2-3). However, he never devoted himself to the elaboration of a specific methodology for empirical social research.\nperception (Bessy and Chateauraynaud, 1995; Chateauraynaud and Debaz, 2017: 606-607).\nGrasps are products of human agency in its attempt to elaborate definitions over objects and processes in a universe that is as material as hermeneutical.\nIt is relevant to point out the proximity between the concepts of grasp and prehension, as well as the scarce presence of Whitehead in the work by Chateauraynaud, which also holds true regarding Mead (Mello, 2019: 173)8. In the present article I address the confluence among Mead, Whitehead and Chateauraynaud in order to propose that the processes encompassed by the concept of prehension must be incorporated by the concept of grasp. This is, accordingly, the centerpiece of the synthetical movement bringing together Mead and Chateauraynaud. At this point of the article, I must introduce an analytical distinction between inner and outer grasps9. The basic difference between them is determined by the object of each one: in the former, internal affairs experienced by an actor are the main object, while in the latter the object lies outside the actor’s innerscape. In empirical reality a clear distinction between inner and outer grasps is not possible. We may think of them as interchangeable and communicable analytical perspectives, one directed to the study of problems and inquiries within the courts of the self, the other focused on social and environmental problems which different selves take part in.\nWhen it comes to human reflexivity, outer grasps are processes of ontological characterization of objects the actors interact with in their environments. Their existence implies the operation of inner grasps, because the same interaction promotes, at a greater or lesser degree, the reorganization of the self through the “me” and the “I”, which are responsible for conducting into interiority the material and conventional supports at stake in the resolution of the experienced problem and for the manifestation of the active element responsible for the personal mark in the subject’s response, respectively.\nInner grasps are in motion when the individual presents itself as its own object, when its own self occupies the center of the problems and inquiries it experiences at a given moment. On such occasions, the greatest test put to the self lies on coping with the problem rising within the “enduring pattern” shaping the individual, to grasp issues affecting its 8 Indeed, this similarity is suggested by the long excerpt from Mead quoted above. We may elaborate from it an image of prehension as the gripping movement of a hand that tactfully affords a sense of continuity between what is sensed in one of its regions and what lies in its opposite area.\n9 See Mello (2017) for the initial definition of inner and outer grasps regarding collective subjectivities.\nBesides concentrating on individual subjectivity, the present article dives much deeper in Mead’s work in order to substantiate the pair of concepts.\ninmost sphere by the “lasting character of here and there, of now and then” built along its biographical trajectory. Referring back to the Jamesian Mead (1903; James, 1955 [1890]: 213ff), we may state that, by holding an inner grasp, a person is apprehending its scope of memories, expectations, ideas, emotions, perceptions, and actions, whether they are informed by material or conventional supports, in a specific perspectival conformity that maintains its sense of intimacy and inner correspondence along an ever-changing relational existence with itself and the environment. Not only grasps over external objects, i.e. outer grasps, are compromised in contexts of ascendancy. Inner grasps are loosened, one’s ontological control over its own self is weakened, and an asymmetry is installed to favor other parties. Chateauraynaud’s sociology benefits from this procedure by accessing stronger terrain in order to deal with transactions between subjectivities and externalities sustaining generative existential processes. By taking this step we enable the concept of grasp to work as the existential pillar of a pragmatic sociology of interiority10.\nTwo important topics must be addressed regarding this Meadian-inspired formulation of the inner grasp. The first one is related to the compatibility between synthesis and disruption in the work of the “I”. The “I” may act as a disruptive force as the individual sees itself from a new angle during the self-inquiry engaged by it in the context of a problematic experience. However, a synthetical movement still guides it, as it seeks to leave behind the existential discomfort set in place once a problem has been established. Thus, disruption has to do with the contrast between the contents mobilized in the course of self- inquiry and the initial frame of the problem one is experiencing11.\nThe second topic complements the first and resumes the issue of the tension between the “I” and the “me” as approached towards the end of the previous section. As stated at that moment, both phases strive to grasp each other in the context of inner problematic situations. Chateauraynaud’s pragmatic sociology brings substance to this 10 In sociology, Thomas and Znaniecki (1918-21) were pioneers in developing a biographical analysis of the individual “life-organization” inspired by the legacy of pragmatism. Strauss (1959), in his turn, clearly borrowed the pragmatist conceptions of problem and inquiry (although without explicit reference to them) for analyzing self-identity through his discussion of “self-appraisals”. Corrêa (2021) has similarly followed this path recently, also proposing a dialogue between classical pragmatism and contemporary pragmatic sociology.\n11 Some complementary observations on this topic: 1) By “existential discomfort” I mean a form of dissatisfaction untied to any specific state of emotion. In light of this, peace, stillness and joy may be sources of existential discomfort just as unrest, suffering or misery; 2) given 1, by mentioning a movement away from such discomfort I evidently do not rely on the structural-functional argument of a constant human necessity of stability and social conformation, as conformation itself may be the cause of discomfort in the first place; 3) the synthetical movement set forth by a problem is not rectilinear or predictable; 4) because of 3, the exercise of a synthetic movement does not guarantee at all that a reconstruction will come to term, since a person may found itself in a continuous process of self-search without ever achieving a stationary solution.\ndiscussion. With his version of the concept of tests (épreuves), pervasive in pragmatic sociology, Chateauraynaud (2004: 169) invites us to think that the disintegration caused by a problem can not make disappear entirely the material and symbolic properties of beings involved in it. This reasoning is fully in line with Mead’s theory of the act. We may then assert that in order to conduct reconstruction and (re)gain an inner grasp, the “I” must deal with both cooperation and resistance offered by elements in the objective phase of the self.\nIn order to grasp oneself, a person must go through tests whose content is linked to the configuration of the problematic experience12. It is the result of these tests, in which the “I” and the “me” communicate more or less contentiously, which will determine the amount of permanence or transformation of the self. Like outer grasps on collective problems, inner grasps are also constantly put to the test by what one experiences in social situations.\nBased on such an articulation, we have observed that the bias caused by asymmetric ascendancy produces its effects on the relations of the self with its own internal province and with its environment; its effects stretch down to the self’s very sense of reality developed in its interactions with the other selves and the world. The ontological politics found in the new mastery of nature projects itself over the territories of experience of different strata of the world population, not just as a new grammar of relations with the environment, but, equally, as an existential prescription that naturalizes flexibility as a principle for the orientation of the self. The dynamics between the “I” and the “me” pointed out in the second part of this text is fully connected to this process.\nThe internal components of the self are also coveted by this form of existential ascendancy, since its goal is to influence the behavior of social actors. In order to further assess this assertion, I must take the case of climatic change policies mentioned by Pellizzoni (2015: 4): according to him, the new approach towards nature becomes normative when, among other factors, it boosts the overlapping of the principle of adaptation to that of mitigation in these regulations. This process leads to the normalization of uncertainty and spreads the imperative of flexibility to adapt to new situations as a form of individual responsibility in face of risks. The emphasis on the concept of adaptation, as it was molded and disseminated by multi-lateral actors, such as the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), shifts the focus of measures regarding risks from a paradigm of stability to that of adequacy to environmental instabilities (Jennings, 2011: 12 Périlleux (2001) speaks of “self-tests” (épreuves du soi) in an approach closely linked to that of Boltanski and Chiapello (1999).\n240). According to Grove (2014: 204), the adaptation discourse in contemporary climate- change and disaster policies heads towards the production of forms of life “appropriate” to contexts under risk, which are responsive to them and capable of forging their actions based on signs of threat. Just as assessed by Jennings (2011), the study by Grove suggests that, oftentimes, one of the consequences of implementing adaptation policies is the establishment of asymmetric relations between government and local populations that atomizes social responsibility for risks by transferring it from the state to the individual level. Once exposed to educational and qualification programs and to awareness initiatives, individuals are expected to engage in reviews of their own attitudes in order to make themselves pliable to the contingency of milieus (Grove, 2014: 203ff). An adaptable self is then vaunted, flexible enough to adequate to, and even to profit from, the unavoidable indeterminacy of nature and to be responsible enough to know that its fortune in this risky setting depends mainly on its individual behavior.\nIt is worth highlighting that such a critical consideration about the concept of adaptation refers to its hegemonic, contemporary version, which is consolidated in the official circles of the United Nations and national governments. The term presents a polysemic spectrum, and pragmatism itself houses a conception of adaptation related to its ecological interpretation of agency. The first generation of critical theory clung to a troublesome reduction of such an interpretation as a form of political conformism, when, by talking about adaptation, pragmatists actually “[…] never meant routine and loss of subjectivity but practical innovation, creative solutions to real problems.” (Joas, 1985 [1980]: 83, emphasis in original)13. Based on such logic, and besides the pragmatist difficult relation with conflict that I have herein tried to compensate, adaptation can represent either a way of accommodating to the status quo or to fully transform it. The current hegemonic conception of adaptation can nonetheless be interpreted as a feature to prevent transformation, especially if it is oriented towards a radical revision of risk production in capitalism. Many times, the non-publicized implication of a discourse that advocates for the promotion of empowerment of vulnerable communities, so they can develop their own ways of adaptation, is, in fact, the exclusion of anti-systemic alternatives of response.\nThe flexibilization of life as imperative linked to the new spirit of capitalism brings along a configuration where dealing with risks implies the continuous availability of 13 See Dewey’s (2013 [1934]: 14-15) differentiation between accommodation, adjustment and adaptation and the sociological account of adaptation in contexts of social change in Thomas and Znaniecki (1918-21).\ncognitive and affective arrangements between people and environments. If the new mastery of nature sets a guideline that can lead local actors to lose their grasps over the milieu, it may also promote a forced malleability of life projects, desires and dreams at the inner domains of their selves, which is justified by the need of adequacy to an always mobile horizon of hazards. Based on the conceptual articulation I have addressed earlier, I can talk about the chances of a varying loss not only of outer, but also inner grasps when individuals find themselves under the ascendancy of the hegemonic agenda of contemporary risk policies.\nBy replicating what happens in other neoliberal institutional coordinates (Boltanski and Chiapello, 1999), to the extent that legitimate powers are successful in diffusing the principles of adaptation and flexibilization, it is possible that a tendency for the reduction of autonomous determination of the perspectives of local actors may develop. This is due mainly to the interference in their selves’ inquiry space. The “I” lies in the center of this dynamics of ascendancy, since it is necessary to encapsulate its singularizing activity within a behavioral program ruled by the ethos of flexibility and adaptability. However, due to the striking contingency of the “I”, the logic of adaptation opts for an indirect form of control. It reaches the objective phases (“me”) of its target audience, provides them with justifications for an individualized responsibility towards risk and diminishes the room for autonomous responses of the “I”. This “culture of safety” (Grove, 2014: 205) espoused by many risk reduction official managers, is entangled with the perspective of the ontological instability of the environment, result of material manipulations upon nature’s properties. As a result,, the tests biasing these audiences’ inner grasps towards adaptable versions of their selves are sustained by both conventional and material supports. In the end, we observe that the depoliticizing outer grasps laid by the new mastery of nature upon its resistance to typical industrial exploration are mirrored by the exaltation of a flexibilizing model of inner grasp with the purpose of ascendancy.\nConclusion The discussion about the contemporary ontological politics based on Mead’s philosophy stands out due to the sensibility of his naturalist pragmatism to the entanglement of the natural and the social. With the aid of his perspective we observe that new forms of political coordination of nature derive from reciprocal modifications in perspectives between human communities and the biogeophysical world. With that in view, the integration of subjective processes of the self within a critical appreciation of society cannot dispense with the disclosure of the engines of mesological ascendancy that entertain human relations. Thus, the reassessment of risks as opportunities favors an asymmetric form of ontological flexibilization that affects life from its molecular level to the symbolic exchanges at social plan.\nThroughout the article, Markell’s rescue of James and Dewey’s influence on Mead’s initial definition of the concepts of “I” and “me” have worked as the basis for the reinterpretation of the relationship between materiality and subjectivity in the final, Whiteheadian phase of his work, and it enabled a new outlook over the role of materiality in the composition of the self. This was the background for the articulation between Mead’s pragmatism and Chateauraynaud’s sociology, which proposed the former’s concept of self as the fundament for the pragmatics of interiority envisaged by the latter, rendering it a Meadian twist. By bringing together these two authors, I sought to contribute with an alternative to the hegemonic interpretation of the internal dynamics of the Meadian self in sociology, more sensible to the material contours of subjectivity. What has been developed in this article lays the foundations for this endeavor, which shall be further explored both theoretically and empirically in future occasions. The idea of self-inquiries as one’s attempt to grasp itself may be unfolded both internally, through the access of other regions in the works of its two central authors, or externally, by bringing into its synthesis other references converging to the general conception of self sketched throughout the text.",
