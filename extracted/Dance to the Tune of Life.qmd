Dance to the Tune of Life

Biological Relativity

In this thought-provoking book, Denis Noble formulates the theory of
biological relativity, emphasising that living organisms operate at multiple
levels of complexity and must therefore be analysed from a multi-scale,
relativistic perspective. Noble explains that all biological processes operate
by means of molecular, cellular and organismal networks. The interactive
nature of these fundamental processes is at the core of biological relativity
and, as such, challenges simplified molecular reductionism. Noble shows that
such an integrative view emerges as the necessary consequence of the rigorous
application of mathematics to biology. Drawing on his pioneering work in the
mathematical physics of biology, he shows that what emerges is a deeply humane
picture of the role of the organism in constraining its chemistry, including
its genes, to serve the organism as a whole, especially in the interaction
with its social environment. This humanistic, holistic approach challenges the
common gene-centred view held by many in modern biology and culture.

Denis Noble is Emeritus Professor of Cardiovascular Physiology and Director of
Computational Physiology at the University of Oxford, UK. He is the current
President of the International Union of Physiological Sciences and a Fellow of
the Royal Society.

### Preface

The central message of this book is that living organisms are open systems.
That refers to all parts of organisms. All the molecules, organs and systems
dance to the tune of the organism and its social context. Those molecules
include the sequences of DNA we now call genes.

  * How do all these components of life dance together in harmony?

  * When did their billion-year dance begin?

  * What makes them dance?

  * Why is their dance relativistic?

  * What do we mean by a ‘gene’?

  * What do we mean by ‘life’?

  * How can ‘life’ depend on ‘dead’ molecules?

  * And what is Biological Relativity?

The answers to these questions form the subject of this book. We will also
address the question of meaning. Could all this really happen as a consequence
of ‘blind chance’? And what could that commonly used phrase possibly mean?
What, indeed, do we mean by ‘meaning’? Could meaning itself be subject to a
relativity principle: a relativity of epistemology?

If these questions fascinate you, then read on.

You will not need to know a lot of science to understand the book: what you
will need is a new set of eyes. I will encourage the reader to adopt the eyes
and mind of an inquisitive explorer. The scientific knowledge you need to know
will mostly be in the book. If you already know a lot of science, you may need
to relearn what you thought you knew. Because the central message is that
twentieth-century biology went up the wrong street in the interpretation and
presentation of its many impressive discoveries.

The reason is that some very influential twentieth-century biologists
presented a simplistic gene-centred view of biology using memorable metaphors
and brilliant writing to encourage you to adopt their view. And in this they
were very successful. Hardly any biological discovery today is presented in
the popular media without reference to the discovery of this or that gene
‘for’ something or other.

This book will show you that there are no genes ‘for’ anything. Living
organisms have functions which use genes to make the molecules they need.
Genes are used. They are not active causes.

This book will show you that there is no complete programme in our DNA.
Programmes, if useful at all as a concept in biology, are distributed across
scales in the organism.

This book will show you that there is no privileged level of causation, which
is a central statement of the theory of Biological Relativity.

It will also show you that we are now far from certain what a gene is, and
that many of the confusions and misrepresentations of biology arise from
mixing up different definitions of genes and genetics.

We don't know when DNA first evolved. But it is virtually certain that it
already existed two billion years ago. It seems likely that it must have
existed for at least a billion years before that. There are fossils of the
simplest cells that go back to over three billion years ago.1 So, if genes
dance, then they have been doing so for billions of years, in fact for most of
the period of the Earth's existence, which is about 4.5 billion years.

### For the Fainthearted

In spite of the sub-title of this book, don't be afraid if you are not
mathematically trained. I promise you that, with the sole exception of
Einstein's iconic equation e = mc2, there are absolutely no equations in the
main body of the book. Science could not function properly without
mathematics. But, even in the most mathematical areas of science, and biology
is rapidly becoming one of those, it is usually possible to explain the
concepts in common language, once they have been distilled down from the
abstract world of equations.

To help you through some uncharted territory, like the Bellman in Lewis
Carroll's nonsense poem The Hunting of the Snark, remember that ‘what I tell
you three times is true’. I have deliberately included a certain amount of
repetition in the different chapters, usually by expressing the same concept
from a different angle or in a different context. Don't be alarmed if you
think you have read something before. I turn some basic ideas in biology
upside down. That takes a certain amount of getting used to. As you read on
you may come to welcome those nice reminders of a point that is already half-
appreciated. We are all used to this phenomenon in other ways. When we first
see an unfamiliar object we easily mistake it for something else, and have to
look again. That is even more true for unfamiliar concepts.

As an example, the fact that organisms are what we call open systems is
employed in several chapters, from different perspectives. It is by
appreciating the full extent of the development of this concept that a reader
can come to understand its profound significance.

Although this book is critical of the simplistic way in which twentieth-
century biology was often presented, my purpose is certainly not to minimise
the phenomenal experimental achievements. It is rather an appeal for
scientific humility. We are all prisoners of the cultures in which we find
ourselves. Particularly in its theoretical aspects, science cannot be immune
from culture even though it often challenges common and received ideas.
Perhaps the ultimate principle of relativity is the relativity of knowledge,
of epistemology. That is the title of the last chapter. As you journey from
chapter to chapter, fasten your intellectual seatbelts. The ride through the
book may jolt many of your present assumptions about the nature of living
organisms.

### The Sub-Title of the Book: A Challenge for the Future

The first complete draft of this book was finished in 2015, the centenary year
of Einstein's General Theory of Relativity. That was not the initial reason
for the sub-title, but it is a nice and appropriate coincidence. But, before
the reader should judge me for being so presumptuous, let me hasten to add
that what is developed in this book is more like a sketch when compared to the
beautiful mathematical expressions of Special and General Relativity.
Furthermore, I very much doubt whether the principle of Biological Relativity
could be so expressed. We may not have the appropriate mathematics for an
evolutionary process that has been as much a history as a phenomenon that
could be predicted mathematically, except over relatively short time scales.
Many biologists follow the lead of Stephen J. Gould in thinking that if the
evolutionary clock could be set back to any point in history, the process
would not follow the path that it has.

The extension of the principle of relativity to biology, as outlined here, is
therefore more a set of signposts to a path. It opens up vistas that others
better equipped than I might follow wherever they may lead. This is a
challenge to younger scientists. I wrote the book while having the privilege
of being the President of the International Union of Physiological Sciences. I
believe it could be the union of those sciences with the relevant branches of
physics, engineering and mathematics that could lead the way forward in the
future.

### Chapter Guide

[Chapter 1](book-part1.html#CT-bp-1) introduces the general principle of
relativity as it developed in the study of the universe. Understanding the
steps by which the idea of relativity was reached will prepare you for
application of the general principle to biology, which is the core of the
book.

[Chapters 2](book-part2.html#CT-bp-2)–[4](book-part4.html#CT-bp-4) contain the
background knowledge of biology required to understand the later chapters.
[Chapter 2](book-part2.html#CT-bp-2) is a complement to [Chapter 1](book-
part1.html#CT-bp-1) since instead of reaching out to the larger scales of the
universe as a whole it reaches down to the microscopic and molecular
components of our bodies. It will guide you through the various levels of
organisation from molecules to the whole organism. [Chapter 3](book-
part3.html#CT-bp-3) then introduces the processes that characterise life in
the form of networks of interactions. I will give some examples of networks
that involve multiple levels. Multi-level interactions form a central aspect
of Biological Relativity since causation is then not restricted to one level
and is necessarily bi-directional. [Chapter 4](book-part4.html#CT-bp-4) shows
how these components and processes work in the smallest living things – single
cells. The great majority of organisms on Earth are unicellular, and even
multicellular organisms go through a single-cell stage when they reproduce.

[Chapter 5](book-part5.html#CT-bp-5) outlines the current widely held theory
of evolution (Neo-Darwinism) and analyses its main conceptual problems. You
will learn that it is a gene-centric, molecular-oriented view of biology. By
focusing on genes and molecules it cannot answer the question ‘what is life?’
Moreover, it was not Darwin's theory of evolution.

[Chapter 6](book-part6.html#CT-bp-6) explains the central principle of
Biological Relativity. You will learn that organisms are alive precisely
because their processes operate at and between many different scales and
levels. The molecular and other components are constrained by all levels,
including the environment.

[Chapters 7](book-part7.html#CT-bp-7) and [8](book-part8.html#CT-bp-8)
describe the experimental findings that enable an integrative relativistic
theory of evolution to be developed to replace Neo-Darwinism. [Chapter
7](book-part7.html#CT-bp-7) focuses on the ways in which the genetic material,
DNA, has been rearranged during evolution. [Chapter 8](book-part8.html#CT-
bp-8) focuses on the epigenetic and related mechanisms by which the genome is
controlled.

[Chapter 9](book-part9.html#CT-bp-9) returns to the questions asked in
[Chapter 1](book-part1.html#CT-bp-1) and develops a form of relativity of our
knowledge of the universe: a relativity of epistemology. It is through this
idea that we arrive at answers that science can give to the big questions
about the universe and ourselves and to an understanding of the limits of
those answers.

[Chapter 10](book-part10.html#CT-bp-10) is written as a brief postscript that
summarises the central argument of the book.

Each chapter begins with an easy way in, often using stories from my personal
experience. As you read on, you will see the relevance of the story to the
main message of the chapter.

You might initially wonder how such a diverse range of topics hangs together
since the book begins with the fundamentals of physics and cosmology, yet ends
with the fundamentals of biology and the limits to our knowledge. You will
discover, perhaps surprisingly, that there are many links between these
various threads. The insights of [Chapter 1](book-part1.html#CT-bp-1) inform
important conclusions in many of the subsequent chapters, and the general
principle of relativity informs the whole book.

It will be clear from this introduction to the various chapters, and how they
link together, that this book is not a textbook of the systems approach to
biology. My aim is rather different. It is to contribute to the new trends in
biology that have become evident during the first decade or so of the twenty-
first century by creating a coherent conceptual framework within which those
trends and their experimental basis can be understood. In any case, there is
no need for me to write a textbook since an excellent one has been published
already: Capra and Luisi's (2014) The Systems View of Life: A Unifying Vision
(Cambridge University Press, 2014). At various points in my book I will cross-
reference this text to guide readers to the relevant parts of their book.
Their vision of the systems approach is very similar to mine.

Notes and glossary. The glossary is an important part of the book. Some key
words have significantly different interpretations and definitions used by
different writers. These include reductionism, Neo-Darwinism, Darwinism,
Lamarckism and epigenetics. When you first encounter these words, you may
benefit from consulting the glossary entries on them.

### Acknowledgements

Working towards writing this book has been a very long journey. Many
colleagues, friends and critics have been companions on that journey.

First, both in time and in what I owe him, is my PhD supervisor, Otto Hutter,
who first set me out on the journey at University College London way back in
1958. Even nearly 60 years later he is still my best critic, and kindly read
many of the draft chapters.

Second is my brother, Ray, who has inspired many of the ideas of this book
ever since his undergraduate days in zoology at Manchester University and more
recently as a medical ethicist at University College London. He spotted the
problems with gene-centric accounts of biology well before I did.

Third are the innumerable students who have studied with me and, in the
process, often taught me their own wisdom over a period of 50 years. Nothing
can prepare you for the ‘wow’ moment when a student brings a razor sharp new
mind to an old problem and cuts through the standard textbook guff.

Fourth are fellow academics from all over the world who have criticised and
helped to smooth the wilder aspects of my journey. They have particularly
included scientists and philosophers at Balliol College over many years. I am
deeply privileged to have worked in such a richly interdisciplinary Oxford
college.1 Some of the lectures and videos referred to in this book were
recorded by Voices from Oxford, based at Balliol College, and I am very
grateful to the Director, Professor SungHee Kim, for all the advice and help
she and the Voices from Oxford team have given.

Finally, I especially thank those who have trenchantly disagreed with me. Some
of them may well say that I didn't take much notice of them. Not really true.
But it is true that often enough they influenced me in ways that they might
not recognise.

An intellectual journey in which you end up in a place very different from
your starting point can often be lonely, a kind of pilgrim's progress with
many doubts on the way. To all who have helped, hindered or just lent a kindly
ear, I thank you.

The full technical details for parts of this book were first published as
invited articles in Science, Molecular Systems Biology, Philosophical
Transactions of the Royal Society, Interface Focus, Journal of Experimental
Biology, Journal of Physiology, Experimental Physiology, Physiology News and
other journals and books published between 2008 and 2015. I am grateful to the
editors of these journals and books and to the referees for many valuable
comments and criticisms. The ideas in this book have been through extensive
peer review.2

Finally, I thank those who kindly read and criticised early drafts of
particular chapters or of the whole book. I am particularly grateful to
Geoffrey Bamford, Sir Patrick Bateson, Nicholas Beale, Steven Bergman, Dario
DiFrancesco, Yung Earm, Martin Fink, Otto Hutter, Eva Jablonka, Mike Joyner,
Sir Anthony Kenny, Ard Louis, Colin Meyer, Derek Moulton, Raymond Noble, Susan
Noble, Kazuyo Tasaki, Toshiaki Tasaki, David Vines and Michael Yudkin, many of
whom gave me valuable feedback and detailed corrections. I also thank the
Press reviewers for very helpful feedback.

### The Sky at Night

Now that most of humanity lives in cities, it has become rare for us to
experience the full extent of the wonder that our predecessors must have felt
as they saw the night sky from open country or from their unlit dwelling
places. On every clear moonless night they would have experienced what we can
do only by going to remote parts of the countryside far away from the city
lights. They would have noticed that as dusk gives way to night, more and more
stars appear. And as their eyes slowly adapted to the dark, even more would
appear until they became uncountable. On a really clear, cold night they would
also experience the feeling that the universe is somehow alive with activity
as the faintest stars seem to appear and disappear depending on whether one
looks directly at them or at a slight angle. There is a depth also to the
sheer blackness of space between the stars that contrasts so markedly with its
light blue during the day. The sky at night viewed in this way, when there is
little or no moonlight, is a miracle, with a giant belt (the Milky Way)
running across it, with countless stars appearing, more the longer we look,
and with the occasional larger movement as a meteor appears. To crown the
spectacle, it moves slowly and majestically throughout the night.

Faced with such glory and spectacular beauty, we are forced to ask a question.
Why?

The question pushes its way before us. And the human response to this question
has always been the same: to propose an answer. We find it difficult to live
without answers. That is what drives our metaphysical instincts, which in turn
create our systems of religious and scientific thought. They are not so far
apart as many might think. The quest for meaning can be seen as the religious
instinct. The quest for explanation in terms of cause can be seen as the
scientific instinct. But the two connect through the fact that we cannot even
begin to develop an explanation without making some meaningful assumptions
about the framework within which we can interpret what we see, feel and hear.
We need a metaphysics within which we can develop our physics. That is as true
today as it was in the earliest scientific discoveries, as we will see as the
story in this book develops. Science also contributes to understanding meaning
through identifying what we call function. It is too simplistic to say that
science deals only with ‘how?’, while religion deals only with ‘why?’. The two
questions intertwine.

So, what did our ancestors do to make sense of what they saw in the darkest of
nights in the deep countryside? They saw groups of stars, what we today call
constellations. They also imagined that these groups had meaning and so they
gave them names. There is one particular constellation, the one we now call
the Big Dipper or The Plough, which received names in all the main historical
traditions we know about. Many saw a bear, which is why its Latin name is Ursa
Major, the great bear. It appears in Babylonian and Egyptian astronomy,
leading to the Greek system, and in the Jewish system which leads to its
reference in the Bible.1 It appears in ancient Chinese2 and Indian3 astronomy,
and in every other traditional system. In fact, this constellation is only one
of two (the other is Orion) that appear as such in both the Western and
Eastern astronomical traditions. The Chinese divided the sky up in a different
way, based on the pole star, Polaris, whereas the Greeks thought in terms of
the relationship of the constellations to the way the sun appears to move
amongst them during the year, which is what gave us the signs of the zodiac.

Dividing up the sky into constellations was very practical. Relating them to
the pole star was particularly helpful to travellers and mariners. Ursa Major
points towards the pole star and could therefore be used to find north. It was
also possible to use the sky as a timekeeper since it rotates smoothly
throughout the night. If one knows the constellations well and how their
movements change during the year, one can work out what time of night it is.
All of this was important to people navigating through open seas and deserts.
The sky was their signpost and clock. Those highly practical results arose
from the smooth circular movement of the heaven above us as it rotates around
the Earth.

Or does it? Today, we know that assumption is wrong. But it is instructive to
understand the steps by which we came to that conclusion. Therein lies the
origin of the principle of relativity.4 Most people think that the principle
applies only to physics. One of the purposes of this book is to show that, in
its widest sense, it must apply also to biology. First we must understand its
use in physics, which is the purpose of this chapter. We will then be able to
explore its impact on biology.

Before I outline the steps by which the fundamental principle of relativity
developed, I would like to ask the reader to adopt the attitude of an
inquiring explorer. It is easy for us to laugh at what we see as the
misunderstandings of the past. A flat earth? Absurd! A heavenly globe
containing the stars? Ridiculous! With that attitude, it is also easy to
forget that we will be seen as ancestors in the future. How do we know that
we, and we alone amongst the tens of thousands of years of human thought, have
at last got the answers right? Many thoughtful scientists today are convinced
that there are more revolutions to come and are not at all happy with our
current models of nature.

Those models are brilliantly successful at prediction, much more so than ever
before. But as a basis for understanding, for feeling certain that we have
‘got it’, they leave much to be desired. We find it difficult, for example, to
unify the physics of the smallest scales, where quantum mechanics is relevant,
and the physics of large scales, where general relativity dominates. Nor do we
know how to explain the apparently arbitrary nature of the constants of the
universe,5 although we know that they need to be within narrow limits for our
universe to exist and for living systems to be possible. In biology, there are
many more puzzles calling out for answers: what is life? How did we as a
species get to be the way we are? What is a gene? And many more. In the search
for those answers, we followed a largely blind alley during the twentieth
century. The blind alley is the idea that the genome is the ‘book of life’, a
blueprint from which you and me, and all other living creatures, were made.

We have more to learn from the history of thought about the universe than we
might think. If we take each step seriously and understand why it was taken,
we will then understand better what steps we can take in the future to
distance ourselves from our own misunderstandings. This book is also an appeal
for humility in scientific thought. It occupies an intellectual space billions
of miles from the naive certainties that many popular science writers portray.
We advance in understanding by first coming to know what we don't understand.
That kind of knowledge requires hard work. We have to undo some of our
cherished basic beliefs.

So, join me on a thoughtful and provocative journey through the questions that
we can't help asking. We begin in this chapter by asking how to interpret the
sky at night, how that question led to the principle of relativity, and to the
Special Relativity and General Relativity forms of the theory proposed by
Einstein.6

### Early Cosmologies

The oldest Hebrew sources represented the Earth as a flat disc floating in a
huge sea. Since no one could consider the possibility of going completely
round the Earth, the idea that the habitable Earth must have an edge, beyond
which was a sea, was a reasonable assumption. The heavens were then
represented as a hollow sphere with the stars set in the surface of the sphere
as points of light in what could be viewed as a massive celestial candelabrum.
Clearly the sphere must move, which creates the difficult question of where it
goes when it moves below the horizon. And there must be several such spheres
since the sun moves separately, and so do the ‘stars’ that we now know are
planets.

One way to think about such a universe is that, since it consists of
concentric spheres, perhaps its centre is also a sphere. That makes it easier
to answer the question of where the spheres go when they disappear below the
horizon. They just go round the central sphere, which must be the Earth. We
don't know when exactly the idea that the Earth too was a sphere first arose,
but we do know that it was a central idea for the astronomer Claudius Ptolemy,
who lived around CE 90 to about CE 168. As his given name, Claudius, suggests,
he was a Roman citizen, although he lived in Egypt when it was ruled from
Rome, and his family name, Ptolemy, is Greek. He wrote in classical Greek.

He is said to have used Babylonian astronomical data to construct an elaborate
set of tables and mathematical calculations brought together in the first
surviving textbook of astronomy, called the Almagest. It includes ingenious
geometrical calculations from a Greek mathematician, Hipparchus, which allowed
estimations of the distances from the Earth to the sun and the moon. These
calculations enabled the celestial spheres to be given dimensions and
distances. In addition to the sphere carrying the sun, additional spheres
carried the planets, and of course the outermost sphere carried the stars. In
addition to the Earth, there were eight spheres carrying the sun, the moon,
five known planets (Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn) and the fixed
stars.

This shift in perception about the Earth and the universe can be represented
as the first stage in developing the principle of relativity. As I will use
this principle in this book it consists of distancing ourselves from
privileged viewpoints for which there is insufficient justification. There are
no absolutes – rather, even in science things can only be understood in a
relative sense: relative to the question we ask; relative to the scale at
which we ask the question; relative to our present knowledge of a universe of
which we will always have questions remaining. In this sense, a privileged
position is akin to an absolute.

Coming to view the Earth as yet another sphere was precisely such a use of
relativity. The Earth was no longer viewed as a uniquely flat object.7 Like
the rest of the universe, it became a sphere. You will learn how this very
general principle of distancing ourselves from supposedly unique or privileged
viewpoints leads to the more familiar theories of relativity later in this
chapter, and then to the theory of Biological Relativity in [Chapter 6](book-
part6.html#CT-bp-6).

Distancing ourselves from viewing the Earth as a flat object may not have been
easy. Many nineteenth-century writers thought that the idea of a flat Earth
was originally so convincing that when Christopher Columbus set off in 1492 to
sail west in order to arrive at the east, uneducated people still feared that
he might reach the edge of the Earth, and perhaps never be seen again. This is
a modern myth.8 Medieval scholars were quite clear that the Earth was round.
The mistake Columbus made was to calculate that East Asia was much closer.
Finding the Caribbean islands saved him and his crew, and he still believed he
had found the East.

### The Copernican Revolution

Distancing ourselves from the geocentric view takes us to another great
astronomer, Nicolaus Copernicus. Copernicus was born in 1473 in the Kingdom of
Poland, and studied first at the Jagiellonian University in the then capital,
Krakow. Later he moved to Italy and the famous universities of Bologna, Padua
and Ferrara. Along with the anatomist Vesalius, he became one of the great
polymaths of the Renaissance and a trigger of the Scientific Revolution. His
book on the universe, De revolutionibus orbium coelestium (on the revolutions
of the heavenly spheres) was published just before his death in 1543.9

The idea that the sun might be the centre of the universe was not entirely
new. Similar ideas had been proposed in the third century BC by Aristarchus.
We know this because Archimedes describes how Aristarchus thought that the
fixed stars and the sun are unmoved, while the Earth revolves around the sun.
Aristarchus also correctly thought that the fixed stars were very far away.

Copernicus, though, deserves the credit for providing the mathematical basis
to show that the idea was predictive, and that it explained the strange fact
that on the geocentric view the planets seem sometimes to move backwards. The
Ptolemaic system had been made more complex in order to deal with this problem
by postulating the existence of further epicycles.10 This illustrates a
pattern that is often repeated in science. Well-loved theories do not usually
die suddenly. People try to find ways of retaining the central ideas of the
theory while adding complexity to the explanations to accommodate observations
that do not seem to fit the theory. Sometimes, the adoption of a new theory
depends more on the overall weight of evidence, rather than on a single knock-
down observation. We will have the opportunity to observe this process in
science in later chapters of this book.

The clarity with which Copernicus stated the heliocentric view was impressive.
He expressed his ideas as seven assumptions. First, that there is not one
centre. This was to allow him to retain one aspect of geocentrism, which is
that the moon orbits the Earth. This was explicitly stated in his second
assumption, together with the statement that the Earth is not the centre of
the universe. Instead, in assumption three he stated that the sun is or is
near the centre of the universe. He then made a remarkable deduction. From
observations of distances, he concluded that the distance to the stars is much
greater than the distance of the Earth from the sun. His fifth assumption is
also remarkable. This is that the motion of the stars represents simply the
spinning motion of the Earth. The fixed stars are just that: fixed,
immoveable. Assumption six gives the Earth an additional motion, that of
orbiting the sun. Finally, he explained the Ptolemaic apparently ‘backwards’
movements of the planets as due to the Earth's motion.

This was the second application of the general principle of relativity.
Arguably, it may have been the most important one since abandoning the
privileged position of the Earth as the centre of the universe was a first
step. That idea leads inevitably to the more familiar theories of relativity
since, once we abandon the idea that our home, the Earth, is in any way
special, why should we be convinced that anything else is the centre of the
universe?

But it did not do so immediately. In fact, the ideas of Copernicus did not
initially create any great waves of controversy. Significantly, there was no
dramatic argument with religious thinkers. This fact is very important in the
story of this book. Religious thinkers treated Copernicus as they treated
themselves: as metaphysical theorists struggling to make sense of the world
and the universe. This is hardly surprising since he was also a canon of the
Catholic Church. Moreover, other church leaders had also proposed ideas
similar to those of Copernicus. Two centuries earlier the French bishop Nicole
Oresme had considered the proposition that the Earth rotates. In fact, his
Livre du ciel et du monde contains the spirit of relativity, since he showed
that to assume that the Earth is rotating rather than the heavens would not
change any of the astronomical calculations. He appreciated the fact that
different metaphysical standpoints can lead to the same conclusions concerning
relative movements. His work did not, however, lead to a revolution of thought
in the way that Copernicus’ work did. In fact, he concluded that there was no
proof that the Earth rotates – and no disproof either!

In the fifteenth century, the German Cardinal Nicholas of Cusa had expressed
in a book called De Docta Ignorantia (roughly translated as ‘On scientific
ignorance’) a viewpoint that is infused with the central idea of relativity:
‘Thus the fabric of the world will have its centre everywhere and
circumference nowhere.’ This is remarkable since it also anticipates the later
stage of questioning whether even the sun (or any other point) could be the
centre of the universe. Not surprisingly, he also developed a sophisticated,
some would say mystical, concept of god.11

These historical facts are important. They show that the widely held view that
every major advance in science has provoked reaction from conservative
religious thinkers is far too simplistic. The more accurate historical view is
that these debates about the nature of the universe occurred as much within
the Church as outside it. Arguably, Nicholas of Cusa was the greater
revolutionary than Nicolaus Copernicus since he was way ahead in questioning
even the idea of giving a privileged position to the sun, or any other
celestial object.

As to opposition to Copernicus, there were opponents both within and without
the Church. Wider scientific acceptance of his ideas had to wait for more
experimental proof anyway. This came with the work of Galileo and the first
use of the telescope (Figure 1.2).

(Jan Sandberg, Wikimedia).

### Galileo: Father of Modern Science

Galileo Galilei was born in 1564 and studied medicine at the University of
Pisa. It was Einstein who called him the ‘father of modern science’. He
transformed our study of the universe. He did so using his own early telescope
of very limited power (magnification about ×20), so with even a modest modern
telescope you can easily repeat some of Galileo's key observations, which he
made on 7 January 1610.

The planet Jupiter can often be seen as a bright object. Amongst the planets,
only Venus is brighter. Its position in the sky depends of course on its
movements, so you need to consult a guide to its position on any given night.
It is easily the largest planet, a gas giant 11 times the Earth's diameter.
Unless there can be living systems very different from what we know, it could
not support life. However, it has many moons and four of these are so large
that they could be observed by Galileo. You can also see them. They are
arranged on the same plane so you will see them strung out on either side of
Jupiter. They orbit Jupiter in a matter of days, so you can also repeat
another of Galileo's observations, which is to see that they are in different
positions every night. Galileo, of course, saw the point. Here is a miniature
solar system with Jupiter acting as the attraction in place of the sun and the
moons playing the role of the planets. It is hard to make these observations
without realising that the Earth must also go round the sun. And that the
planets that do so can have moons just as the Earth has a moon. While Jupiter
itself is very unlikely to harbour life, its moons might do so. Europa has a
surface of ice and water which might well support life.

Galileo's observations and his defence of the heliocentric idea came about 60
years after Copernicus’ publication of his work. This time, the mood within
the Church was different. Some, notably amongst the Jesuits, supported him.
But it is thought that intrigue at the Vatican led to Urban VIII, who had been
a supportive friend, even encouraging him to publish his work, becoming
offended by what could be seen to be mockery of him and the geocentric view in
Galileo's book Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems.12 The defender
of the geocentric view was a character called Simplicio, which carries the
connotation of simpleton. Offending friends by mocking them may not be wise.
Perhaps Galileo meant no offence. Simplicio was simply a literary device.

There have been many books and articles written on these events and the
subsequent famous ‘recantation’ of Galileo.13 It is true that Galileo was
found guilty of heresy by the inquisition and put under house arrest, while
his books were banned. The ban on his books was not lifted until the
eighteenth century. Famously, in 1992 Pope John Paul II expressed regret for
the events that led to the Church accusing him of heresy and subjecting him to
house arrest.

It is right to condemn the seventeenth-century Vatican inquisitors. They were
certain they were right and Galileo was wrong, so wrong that he had to be
humiliated and punished. It took nearly four centuries for the injustice to be
openly acknowledged. It is one of the strange characteristics of metaphysics
that, while its very speculative nature should convince people to be cautious,
even humble, it often does just the reverse. Perhaps the very uncertainty
creates the inner wish for certainty. That, after all, is also part of the
religious instinct – the search for the certainty of faith. Scientists, even
atheistic scientists, are not immune to the same problem. If you think that
could not happen, that scientists could not be so cruel, wait until you read
in later chapters the way in which twentieth-century scientists ridiculed the
great French biologist Jean-Baptiste Lamarck and sidelined almost completely
the brilliant developmental biologist and polymath Conrad Waddington.

### The Earth from a Billion Miles (Figure 1.3)

Galileo would surely have been delighted to see the Earth from the giant
planet Saturn, as we can now do thanks to the voyage of the spacecraft
Cassini. He would have seen the Earth as a tiny blue dot just as we view other
planets as small objects in the solar system. Hardly a candidate for the
centre of the universe! Outside our solar system the Earth would not even be
directly visible. Its presence could be detected only indirectly, just as we
now detect what are called exoplanets, planets circling other stars to produce
a tiny fluctuation in the light from them, and the tiny perturbations of the
star's position.

the Earth from Saturn. But this is minuscule compared to the more than 13
billion years for light to reach us from the edge of the observable universe

### Newton's Laws of Motion

It is one thing to show that planets orbit the sun, and moons orbit the
planets. It is quite another thing to show how those motions could be
explained. Our own experience teaches us that for something to move
continually there must be a force making it do so. Mechanics before Newton
adopted the same common sense view. Without a force, an object would stop
moving. Newton reversed that. Without a force it would continue moving! Not
just temporarily, like the supermarket trolley after a brief push, but
permanently. It would never stop. Imagine the trolley continuing on its motion
until it goes right around the Earth and returns to you! A satellite in orbit
does precisely that.

Newton's laws are so familiar to us now that it is difficult to imagine how
counterintuitive they must have seemed in his day. People were so used to the
idea that hard work had to be done to move anything around, whether on a farm,
in the house or along the streets. If the planets moved indefinitely then
something (angels?) had to be moving them.

Newton was born in 1643 and had quite a difficult childhood. He studied at
Trinity College Cambridge and graduated in 1665 just before the university
closed because of the plague. It was while at home for two years that he
developed his brilliant mathematics. This included calculus, his optics and
the law of gravitation. Not bad for a two-year stint at home! He returned to
Cambridge in 1667 to become a Fellow, and only two years later was given the
prestigious Lucasian Chair. He was unorthodox enough to avoid the rules that,
at that time, required all the Fellows and Professors to be ordained. One can
speculate that it was his very unorthodoxy that stood him in good stead in
challenging so many ideas of his time.

Newton must have realised that, of course, there is an everyday example of
continual motion: a falling object does not stop until it hits the ground. On
the contrary, it accelerates. There was therefore no need to suppose that the
moon needs something to push it round the Earth. It just goes on falling. But
because it already has lateral motion it will combine that motion with the
fall due to gravity to produce overall motion in an orbit. If the moon was in
deep space it would just travel indefinitely in a straight line.

This insight established several important things that are relevant to the
principle of relativity and to our story. The first is that celestial objects
experience the same forces and motions as those on Earth. We prove that today
every time we send a satellite into orbit. If we give the satellite enough
speed it will ‘escape’ the Earth's gravitational attraction and go into orbit.
Actually, it never escapes gravity. It is rather that the force of gravity and
the inertial motion we have given it combine, just as they do for the moon, to
enable it to ‘fall’ continually in an orbit around the Earth. The second is
that if we know the forces acting on objects, we could use calculus to predict
their motions indefinitely.

There was, however, one problem relating to the principle of relativity that
Newton had difficulty solving. Where was the centre of the universe? Could it
be the sun? But he also understood that the centre of gravity (which might be
a possible interpretation of ‘centre’) of the solar system was not precisely
the sun. He decided that ‘the common centre of gravity of the Earth, the Sun
and all the Planets is to be esteem'd the Centre of the World’. If he had gone
one step further and recognised, as Nicholas de Cusa had, that ‘the world will
have its centre everywhere’ he would have made the next step into the fully
relativistic idea that there is no centre, and that all movement is relative.

### Nineteenth-Century Certainties

With Newton's equations of motion and the idea that the universe, and perhaps
everything in it, worked rather like clockwork, it seemed that in principle
everything could be predicted with just the force of gravity and the laws of
motion. The conviction that this must be so became very strong in the middle
of the nineteenth century. Even the apparently strange phenomena of
electricity and magnetism could be accommodated as Faraday and Maxwell showed
how they could be used to produce movement, and in turn be generated by
movement.

The bible of this certainty was the book Celestial Mechanics, produced by the
French mathematician Pierre-Simon Laplace as a series of volumes at the
beginning of the nineteenth century. He was such a brilliant mathematician
that many people called him the French Newton. In his Philosophical Essay he
wrote ‘all the effects of nature are only mathematical results of a small
number of immutable laws’. The clear impression was that, in principle,
everything could be known and accurately calculated in a deterministic
universe.14

It is very relevant to an important message of this book that two brilliant
minds, Newton and Laplace, using essentially the same mathematical tools and
facts about the universe, could come to diametrically opposed metaphysical
conclusions. Newton perceived no conflict at all with his belief that ‘God is
Eternal and Infinite, Omnipotent and Omniscient.…He endures forever, and is
everywhere present; and by existing always and every where, he constitutes
Duration and Space.’15 Laplace, living more than a century later, came to the
opposite conclusion. He may or may not have told Napoleon Bonaparte ‘I have no
need of that [the God] hypothesis’, but the quip certainly reflected his
atheistic interpretation of Newton's mechanics.

Yet, according to another French mathematician, Joseph Fourier, Laplace's last
words were ‘What we know is little, and what we are ignorant of is immense.’ I
like the idea that even Laplace was so cautious.

His influence on other nineteenth-century scientists was profound. In biology,
in particular, he clearly influenced the physiologist Claude Bernard. This is
very relevant to the story in subsequent chapters of this book.

With the universe safely wrapped up in Laplace's interpretation of Newton's
equations of motion and with even the most innovative thinkers in biology,
like Claude Bernard, convinced that all they needed to do was to use the
understanding of the physical sciences in studying biology, it must have
seemed that science was well on the path to its ultimate goal in the
explanation of everything. The great physicist Lord Kelvin expressed this
great confidence in 1900: ‘There is nothing new to be discovered in physics
now. All that remains is more and more precise measurement.’16 The work of
Darwin, Wallace and others on the theory of evolution, to which we will return
in subsequent chapters, reinforced that view since it promised an
understanding of the living as well as of the inanimate world.

But waiting in the wings were two discoveries that were to shatter this
confidence so far as physics is concerned. They were quantum mechanics and the
further developments of the principle of relativity in the form of the special
and general versions of relativity of Einstein's theories. Just five years
after Lord Kelvin wrote those famous words, they had to be eaten.

### Quantum Mechanics17

The vision of Laplace perfectly expressed nineteenth-century scientific
optimism. It must have seemed that it was only a matter of time before we
could determine where objects are in the world, how they are moving, and then
set the calculators to work. We would then understand what it must be like for
a god to ‘see’ everything at once. The equations of Newtonian mechanics work
just as well going backward as forward. In principle, therefore, we would be
able to know how the world was at all previous times, how it is now and how it
will be at all future times. The dimension of time would indeed be just an
additional, fourth, dimension like the three spatial ones.

But can we know where every object is, and how it is moving? Surely that can
only be a matter of how good our instruments may be. And, however we interpret
it, time does have a direction!

The experiments that led to the development of quantum mechanics show that it
is not possible at the micro level to determine both the positions and
velocities independently and with any degree of accuracy. The experiments show
that particles behave as waves under some circumstances and as particles under
other circumstances. They behave as particles when they hit a detecting
instrument in a particular place and at a particular time. But they behave as
waves when, for example, two of them are allowed to interact to produce the
beautiful interference patterns that are characteristic of colliding waves.
There is a particle–wave duality. To say the least, that is difficult to
visualise. We can visualise a wave as the behaviour of a large number of
elements, such as water molecules in a lake, where the wave is a transmitted
behaviour of the ensemble. No single water molecule travels with the wave. The
molecules simply bob up and down, much like a Mexican wave in a sports
stadium. Similarly, a sound wave is the transmitted behaviour of large numbers
of molecules in the medium, air or fluid or solid, that transmits it. The
molecules of the medium oscillate back and forth but they do not travel with
the wave. But a particle is a discrete object which should be part of an
ensemble to allow a wave to form. How can it also be the wave itself? The
particle that is itself the wave travels with the wave. And when it is
behaving as a wave, what is the medium in which the wave occurs? As we will
see, that question connects with Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity,
discussed in the next section.

A further difficulty is that we can only say where the particle might be with
a certain degree of probability. The same applies to its velocity. There is a
fundamental degree of uncertainty such that the more accurately we try to
determine position, the less certain we can be about velocity, and vice versa.

There are many other ways in which the features and consequences of quantum
mechanics can be expressed, but this characterisation will suffice for the
purposes of this chapter.

Physicists and philosophers have thought deeply about the implications of
quantum mechanics. Early reactions were that this can't be true, or at least
only provisionally true while waiting for something to replace it. Einstein
was very sceptical; he said: ‘God does not play dice.’ Yet, she does! There
seems to be no way around the shocking nature of this discovery. It shakes the
very foundations of nineteenth-century confidence. People have therefore tried
various ways of arguing for minimising the impact. One of these is to say that
this uncertainty applies only at the micro level, the subatomic level. That is
not entirely true. There are conditions, such as very low temperatures, under
which quantum mechanical behaviour has been shown to exist at a macro level.
And people are already using quantum mechanical properties to construct macro-
level machines.

Quantum computers are a good example. They use quantal behaviour to implement
more logical operations simultaneously than can be done with conventional
computers, and experiments have already been done to demonstrate the
feasibility.18 But of course the machine itself must be usable by a human
being. The quantal properties at the micro level will have consequences for
what happens at the macro level. That has already been shown by maintaining
quantal memory states that could be used in such a computer at room
temperature for more than 30 minutes.19 The first demonstrations of such
effects were at exceedingly low temperatures, beyond the range of living
organisms. Some have also speculated, perhaps wildly at this stage, that there
could be features of our brains that allow quantum mechanical effects to play
a role.20

Furthermore, this way of dealing with the problem is not really satisfactory
to someone who wants to know what the world is really like. The best way, at
present at least, to interpret the equations of quantum mechanics is to note
that they work. In fact they work very well for describing what we see. But
they don't provide a satisfactory explanation of the world ‘as it really is’.

This returns us to the big ‘why?’ question posed at the beginning of this
chapter. Possibly, it is the wrong question. There may be aspects of reality
that we can never know. That is not a comfortable position to be in. Our
predecessors asking the big ‘why?’ question on looking at the sky at night
would hardly find this kind of answer satisfactory.

Another approach to this problem is to say that there must be more to be found
out that may lead to a set of physical theories that are more satisfactory.
That is the approach of those who note that there are also other
unsatisfactory features about our present knowledge, not least that we use
different theories for micro and macro levels. Perhaps we should just wait
until another Einstein turns up to sort it all out.

I will return to these questions in the last chapter of the book. Meanwhile,
our story moves on to Albert Einstein.

### Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity

A recurring problem with the various stages of application of the relativity
principle has been the persistent idea that there must always be a medium in
which movement occurs. Early objections to the view that the Earth rotates
were based on the idea that this would be detectable, for example in the winds
that it was thought such movement must create. At the equator, the speed of
rotation is about 1000 miles per hour. If an aeroplane moves through the
atmosphere at this supersonic speed, there is always a supersonic bang. So
where is the bang that the Earth's movement should create? In fact, of course,
there is no bang because the atmosphere rotates with the Earth. So, to a first
approximation, there is no relative speed of the Earth with respect to its
atmosphere. The problem seems even greater when we consider the speed with
which the Earth is orbiting the sun, which is about 67,000 miles per hour.
Again, the answer is that the atmosphere moves with us at this speed. In both
cases, we don't notice the movement because there is no movement relative to
what would make us feel the movement. Only when we compare the Earth's
position relative to objects in the sky do we see the effect of the movement.
These observations already take us well on the way to understanding Special
Relativity. The key point is that we can only detect relative movement.

But consider this. It is nevertheless true that the Earth is moving through
space. If space is the fixed structure that we learnt about in Euclidean
geometry, then surely there must be a way of detecting whether or not we are
moving through this structure. Since the atmosphere moves with us, we won't
notice this by measuring the speed of sound. But what does light move through?
Clearly it must be capable of moving through essentially empty space,
otherwise we would not see the stars. Since we are moving with respect to
space, we should be able to detect this movement by measuring how fast light
travels when it moves with the Earth's movement compared to how fast it moves
when travelling in the opposite direction. There should be a difference.

Another way to think of this is to imagine that space is filled with something
through which objects travel. People called it the ether. If that was so, then
there would be a privileged frame of reference in the universe: it would be
the one in which movement through the ether is zero.

The experiment to test this idea was conducted by Albert Michelson and Edward
Morley at Case Western Reserve University in the USA in 1887. The answer was a
big surprise. There is no difference between the speed of light measured in
any direction. The experiment has been repeated many times with ever-
increasing accuracy and always with the same result. The conclusion is that
there is no ether. There is therefore no privileged frame of reference.21

This is startling. Think about it and you will appreciate just how big a
revolution this set in train. If space is not filled with anything that could
form the basis of a frame of reference then the ‘centre of the universe’ is
nowhere, or perhaps everywhere. Remember Cardinal Nicholas of Cusa, who as
early as 1440 wrote: ‘Thus the fabric of the world will have its centre
everywhere and circumference nowhere.’ It took more than 400 years for the
world to catch up with his insight.

It is not certain whether this experiment was the trigger for Einstein's
Special Theory, but the theory certainly provides an explanation for the
result and so it became a major experimental proof of the theory.22

The fact that the speed of light is the same in all directions and that there
is no privileged frame of reference leads to some counterintuitive
consequences. When two objects are moving with respect to each other, let's
call them A and B, distance and time in B must be perceived by A to be
changed. Similarly, B will perceive A's distances and times to be changed.
This is the phenomenon that leads to the famous space traveller example. A
space traveller leaves Earth and travels a long distance at a very high speed
relative to the Earth, and then returns to Earth. The space traveller will
have aged in what will seem to him to be a normal way, but he will find that
people on Earth have aged even more. By contrast, people on Earth will have
experienced ageing at a normal rate and will think that the space traveller
has discovered the secret of longevity! To them he would appear young.

These consequences lead to the fact that there will be no absolute measure of
simultaneity. If time seems to change at different speeds depending on the
relative velocities of objects, then we no longer have a privileged frame of
reference to which to refer all events in their time sequences. An event that
precedes another one at a distance away from it can appear to follow it if we
change our observer position and relative speed. Think of three objects all
moving with respect to each other: A, B and C. Suppose also that events occur
in B and C that seem to be at the same time to A. Depending on how they are
moving with respect to each other, they will not appear to be simultaneous to
B or C. Their order in time will be different to different observers. Time and
space are therefore no longer absolutes. They can contract and dilate
according to the position and velocity of who is observing the events that
occur.

It is important to note that these contractions and dilations of space and
time do not allow the central rule of causality to be broken, even though
their order in time can appear differently to different observers. The
distance between the two events will always be such that, if the event on B is
the cause of the event on C, no observer could consider C to be the cause of
B.

There are many other surprising consequences of Special Relativity. One of the
most important is that the speed of light becomes an absolute limit. However
much we accelerate an object with mass, it will never achieve the speed of
light. Only an object without mass can do that. Mass and energy also become
inter-convertible according to Einstein's famous equation: e = mc2.

I have summarised rapidly some of the main consequences of the Special Theory
of Relativity. But this is not intended to be a textbook on the theory itself.
Readers who wish to understand more deeply should read other texts – as
suggested at the end of this book. The real purpose of this chapter is to
prepare you for the rest of this book. Just as Einstein's relativity theories
upset some common perceptions about space and time, mass and energy, light and
gravity, so we will find that the consequences of extending the principle of
relativity to biological processes also upsets many common ideas about
causation and the relations between genes and organisms and their
environments. If you find some of the consequences of the principle of
relativity to be surprising or even shocking, you are not alone. Most people
found the consequences of each stage of applying the principle to be
surprising. The important point is the recommendation I made at the beginning
of this chapter. Adopt the eyes of an inquisitive explorer. Don't hold on to
your pre-conceptions unnecessarily.

### Einstein's General Theory of Relativity

The Special Theory applies to the ‘special’ case of frames of reference moving
at a constant speed with respect to each other. Each frame of reference can
obey the rules of Euclidean geometry. In the special theory what we are
abandoning is the idea that space is filled with something, the ether, that
enables us to know whether we are at absolute rest or moving. But for each
frame of reference, space can be treated successfully with the usual (which
means Euclidean) rules of geometry. The angles of a triangle, for example,
will always add up to 180°. A right-angled triangle will always obey the
square rule for the lengths of its sides – the sum of the squares of the short
sides equals the square of the long side.

In his General Theory, Einstein incorporated gravity. In doing so he also
abandoned the assumption that space must be Euclidean. In this version of the
theory, an object that is feeling the effects of gravity moves in a space-time
continuum that is influenced by the masses on which the gravitational field
depends.

General relativity has its most astonishing consequences at large scales when
we are dealing with hugely massive bodies like clusters of galaxies. The way
in which gravity is incorporated into the theory is best represented by saying
it structures space-time around its field of influence. Space is therefore no
longer represented as Euclidean. Space-time is like a sheet that can be bent
and deformed according to the forces that act on it. This is just a two-
dimensional way of representing what must be happening in four dimensions.
Interestingly, mathematicians, such as Bernhard Riemann in 1854, and others
even earlier in the nineteenth century, had already proposed non-Euclidean
curved geometries as mathematical entities. It must have seemed that such
geometries were only of mathematical interest.23 But it happens often that new
mathematics eventually finds applications in the real world.

This move in applying the principle of relativity is the most fundamental so
far. Space-time is no longer independent of the objects within it. Perhaps
even those objects can be represented as distortions of space-time so that
they also are not independent of space-time. The dependence works both ways.
At bottom (whatever we mean by that word – we will come back to that question
later) objects may be just a set of formations in four-dimensional space-time
that require even more metaphysical dimensions to represent what is happening.
Some modern theories that seek to unify the great theories of physics, such as
string theory, use precisely this kind of speculation. A very different
approach is taken in a relatively little-known theory of the relativity of
scales, which goes so far as to abandon the idea that space-time is
continuous. Further reading on these fascinating questions at the very
frontier of physics can be found in the endnotes for this chapter.

### Can We ‘Feel’ the Consequences of Relativity?

If you react to Einstein's Special and General Theories of Relativity in the
way I did when I first learnt about them, you may also follow the logic step
by step, and assent to the conclusions with your head. But what about one's
heart? Can people ‘feel’ its consequences? The early tests of the theories
were remote from everyday experience. Measuring the constancy of the speed of
light was certainly not an everyday experience! One of the first tests of the
bending of space-time by large objects was the observation during a solar
eclipse that a star may appear near the edge of the sun that shouldn't have
been where it seemed if space were Euclidean. There is just enough bending by
the sun's gravity to make that observation possible. But that also was open
only to the few who could make those observations accurately at the time of a
total eclipse, and even they had to make several attempts to capture such a
rare event.

But we now live in a privileged time. Thanks to the Hubble telescope up there
in space and the ready availability of its images online, we can see for
ourselves some of the wonderful discoveries that allow one to ‘feel’ the
bending of space-time. A massive gravitational object can bend space-time and
the light flowing through in a way comparable to a lens.24 The most dramatic
example of this effect is the distortion of light from a distant blue galaxy
by a luminous red galaxy to produce the horseshoe image shown in Figure 1.4.
In this case, there is almost perfect alignment of the distant blue galaxy,
the red galaxy and the Earth to enable the distortion to produce an almost
perfect circle. More frequently, the alignment is not that perfect and the
result is a number of smeared arcs. A full horseshoe shape is itself rare. But
had the alignment been even more perfect we would have seen a full circle
(Figure 1.4).

![](../Images/17624fig1_4.png)

Figure 1.4

A remarkable example of gravitational lensing predicted by the theory of
Relativity. The luminous red galaxy in the centre of this image, LRG 3-757, is
almost exactly in front of a much more distant blue galaxy whose light is bent
by the gravitational ‘lens’ to produce an almost perfect circle (source:
Lensshoe_hubble.jpg: ESA/Hubble & NASA).

There are even more wonderful discoveries that have come from the Hubble Space
Telescope. The last section of this chapter concerns the Hubble deep field
views of the distant universe and how they may be used to estimate the size of
the visible universe. That estimate will prove very useful to our story in
[Chapter 3](book-part3.html#CT-bp-3).

### Hubble's Deep Field Views

This chapter began with the star constellation Ursa Major, and it ends with
it. When astronomers were choosing a part of the sky to enable the Hubble to
look at the very distant universe, they chose a very tiny region (only
one-24-millionth of the whole sky) in order to point the Hubble at it to
collect the light for a period of ten days. There are only four stars from our
galaxy in this area, so to the naked eye and even most telescopes, the area
seems empty, completely black. The Hubble was therefore looking all the way
through our galaxy into far deep space. The area chosen is just above the
‘plough’ of Ursa Major, near where the bear's tail joins its back, which is
the part of the formation that resembles a plough. The resulting image is
amazing. Far from the sky being empty, it shows at least 3000 galaxies, many
of them extremely faint and distant. The light from some of them has taken
around 13 billion years to reach the Earth. In fact, the Earth did not exist
when the light set out on its journey. The Earth is estimated to have been
formed about 4.5 billion years ago (Figure 1.5).

![](../Images/17624fig1_5.png)

Figure 1.5

The Hubble deep field view of one-24-millionth of the sky showing numerous
galaxies right to the edge of the visible universe (source:
[apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap140605.html](http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap140605.html)).

Hubble's fabulous views take us to near the edge of the visible universe. They
also enable a calculation to be made. If the universe looks roughly the same
everywhere, which seems to be true, then by calculating the amount of matter
from the total number of galaxies in the field of view and then multiplying it
by 24 million we can estimate the total number of galaxies in the visible
universe. That gives about 200 billion. Estimating the number of particles
(e.g. protons, which form the hydrogen atom nucleus) in a galaxy at about
1069, the total number of particles in the universe turns out to be about 1080
particles.25 That is a huge number, which would take most of this paragraph to
write out fully, with 80 zeros. In [Chapter 3](book-part3.html#CT-bp-3) we
will compare this number to the number of possible interactions in biological
systems.

### Conclusions

Relativity theory is inevitably associated with the name of Einstein –
correctly so, although others, notably Poincaré, Lorentz, Gauss and Riemann,
also developed many of the key mathematical ideas, and many others have done
so since. Physicists, however, also refer to the general principle of
relativity. By this they mean the distancing of our ideas from presumptions
for which there is insufficient justification. So, many physicists also talk,
completely correctly, about Galilean relativity or Newtonian relativity. Both
Galileo and Newton were applying relativistic ideas, although they did not use
the word relativity.

I think we should go even further. As shown in this chapter, each of the
stages of trying to find the centre of the universe was an application of this
very general principle of relativity. The stages are: first, abandon the idea
of the Earth as flat while all the rest of the universe is spherical; second,
abandon the idea that the Earth is the centre; third, abandon the idea that
the sun is the centre; fourth, abandon the idea of any privileged frames for
movement – movement is always relative; fifth, abandon the idea that there
could be a centre – all frames of reference are equivalent; sixth, abandon the
assumption that space-time is Euclidean.

I also imply that there are more applications of the principle to come in the
future. Some physicists have already proposed extensions of the principle of
relativity – for example, to the relativity of scales, a theory proposed by
the French astrophysicist Laurent Nottale. The rest of this book explores
applications of the principle of relativity in what I call Biological
Relativity, which shares important ideas with the scale relativity theory of
Nottale.

A second implication of this chapter is that there is also a philosophical
principle of relativity. The discoveries of quantum mechanics forced us to
distance ourselves from the idea that the universe is a vast piece of
determinate clockwork. It has also forced some re-thinking concerning how we
can know the world ‘as it really is’. These implications will be explored more
fully in the last chapter. But the lesson is worth bearing in mind throughout
the book.26

7 In this case I have used the word ‘uniquely’ because ‘privileged’ would give
the wrong impression. The idea was not that the Earth was a privileged
‘centre’ of the universe. On the contrary, the flat Earth was regarded as at
the bottom of the universe, with an even worse place, Hell, below it.

21 Over a century later, there is a fascinating twist to this story. A modern
variation of the Michelson–Morley experiment has been developed in attempts to
test an important prediction of Einstein's General Theory of Relativity. This
is that light should be influenced by gravitational waves when objects of
large mass distort space-time. These experiments (called ADVANCED VIRGO in
Europe, ADVANCED LIGO in the USA) use two tunnels at right angles and around
3–4 km in length to detect the exceedingly small effects of gravitational
waves. To achieve this test, the apparatus needs to be trillions of times more
sensitive than that used by Michelson and Morley. See [www.ego-
gw.it/public/virgo/virgo.aspx](http://www.ego-gw.it/public/virgo/virgo.aspx).

made that gravitational waves had been detected for the first time. Abbott,
B.P. et al. Observation of gravitational waves from a binary black hole
merger. Physical Review Letters 116:061102.

22 The Michelson–Morley experiment was first interpreted by the Dutch
physicist Hendrik Lorentz, who proposed that bodies change their magnitude
when moving, which is the Lorentz transformation. Lorentz's equations were
adopted by Einstein, who showed that the experiment and the equations were
consistent with relativity theory, which gave the Lorentz transformation an
‘incomparably more satisfactory’ interpretation (Einstein, Relativity: the
Special and the General Theory, p. 53). In his 1905 paper, Einstein does not
reference Michelson and Morley. The implication is that the experiment was not
itself used to formulate the Special Theory of Relativity, but was seen later
by him to be neatly explained by it. For a historical analysis of the relation
of the Michelson–Morley experiment to the Special Theory of Relativity, see
Arabatsis, T. and K. Gavroglu (2015) Myth 18: that the Michelson–Morley
experiment paved the way for the special theory of relativity. In Newton's
Apple and Other Myths About Science. R.L. Numbers and K. Kampourakis, editors
(Harvard University Press, Cambridge, MA; pp. 149–156).

23 A relatively simple way to grasp the idea is to imagine measuring the
‘shortest distances’ between points on the surface of a sphere. They will
always be the distances along curved lines that form part of circles whose
centre is the centre of the sphere. This is why, in two-dimensional projection
maps of the Earth, aircraft seem to be travelling distances that are longer
than the apparent shortest distance between the points.

structures. Lecture Notes in Physics 360:29–38.

25 This estimate is based on the visible (normal) matter. If we accept that
this is only about 5% of the total energy and matter, including dark energy
and dark matter, then we could increase the estimate by one or two orders of
magnitude, to 1081 or 1082.

26 In writing this chapter, I would like to acknowledge discussions and
debates with many scientific, mathematical and philosophical colleagues on the
topics of relativity and quantum mechanics over many years. I would also like
specifically to acknowledge a lovely book, La relativité dans tous ses etats,
by the French astrophysicist and specialist on gravitational lensing, Laurent
Nottale. Sadly, it exists only in French, but if your French is good enough
you will benefit as I did from reading it. My ideas on the general principle
of relativity owe much to his book. Nottale also has a book in English, Scale
Relativity and Fractal Space-time, but this is not a translation of the
smaller book. It is also highly mathematical and well beyond the scope of most
lay readers. Nottale is the inventor of the theory of scale relativity, which
has influenced my thinking about biological relativity since we share the same
instinct to say that there is no privileged scale. Laurent Nottale and the
French systems biologist Charles Auffray have explored the possible biological
consequences of this idea (Auffray, C. and L. Nottale (2008) Scale relativity
theory and integrative systems biology: 1. Founding principles and scale laws.
Progress in Biophysics and Molecular Biology 97:79–114. Nottale, L. and C.
Auffray (2008) Scale relativity theory and integrative systems biology: 2.
Macroscopic quantum-type mechanics. Progress in Biophysics and Molecular
Biology 97:115–157). It is important to note, however, that my use of the
principle of relativity in this book does not depend on Nottale's specific
theory of fractal space-time. The inspiration from his work lies in extending
the principle of relativity to biological scales.



## 2 Biological Scales and Levels

There are only molecules – everything else is sociology.

Jim Watson (Nobel Laureate, author of The Double Helix)1

### The Sense of Scale

In [Chapter 1](book-part1.html#CT-bp-1) we got a sense of the immensity of the
known universe. Let's now go in the opposite direction, down towards the
smallest scale in living organisms. We will see that it takes almost as many
scale changes to go down to the lowest level as it did to go all the way up to
the whole visible universe.

I was a student in the 1950s when the first electron microscopes were
introduced in biological research. A normal light microscope can magnify up to
about 2000 times.2 By using electrons as the beam instead of photons we can
increase this magnification to at least ten million. To enable the electrons
to form a meaningful image they must pass through only very thin sections of
material, so we cannot use electron microscopes for living cells. That is a
serious limitation, but it is balanced by the fact that we can drill down to
the molecular level. This is the way in which the British scientist Hugh
Huxley saw for the first time the individual molecules called actin and
myosin. These are long protein filaments, and he showed that they must slide
over each other when a muscle contracts. He was even able to see the small
molecular protrusions called cross-bridges that enable this sliding movement
to occur. Another Huxley, Andrew Huxley (not related), was able to make the
same deduction from experiments using clever light microscopy. These
discoveries led to the famous sliding filament model of muscle contraction
(Figure 2.1).

![](../Images/17624fig2_1.png)

Figure 2.1

The first electron micrograph images of the arrangement of protein filaments
in skeletal muscle, together with diagrams showing how the filaments slide
along each other when the muscle changes length (Huxley and Hansen, 1954).3

As medical students at University College London, where Hugh Huxley was
working, we had the opportunity to see where he had his electron microscope.
It felt like entering a holy of holies. We were allowed to enter one by one
through a sliding door into the dark room where the precious instrument was
housed to see for ourselves the beautiful arrays of the filaments. It has
always seemed to me surprising that this work was not honoured with a Nobel
Prize. Andrew Huxley did receive one, but for his work with Alan Hodgkin on
nerves.

At the magnification required to see the muscle filaments the cell that housed
them would have covered the whole of the square mile or so around the
university. That dizzying fact brought home to me the vast ranges of scales on
which biological organisms exist. This chapter explores that range and what
exists at each scale.

### Scales and Levels

Before we extend the principle of relativity to biological systems, we need to
know what living systems are made from and how they are organised. Is the
material of living systems special, or is it just the same as the rest of the
material in the universe? If it is just the same, then what defines the
difference between living and non-living? We can begin to answer those
questions by determining what the components are and how they are organised to
produce the activities of living systems.

There are various ways in which the components of an organism can be
classified. One of these uses the concept of levels of organisation. These
levels can be arranged in an ascending order of size: atoms, molecules,
networks, organelles, cells, tissues, organs, whole-body systems and the whole
organism. Each level can be viewed as assembling the components of the level
below, and then itself forming a component for the level above. We can also go
beyond the organism to add populations, species, clades and the physical
environment, which can also be classified into various levels. To some extent
this order is also an order of scale. Cells, for example, work at a scale much
larger than that of molecules.

Cells themselves are so small that we need a microscope to see them. Yet, they
are enormous compared to atoms and molecules. Each cell contains trillions of
atoms. The same relative difference of scale applies to cells compared to a
whole human body. There are many trillions of cells in a whole human body. The
scales therefore are very different. One way to imagine the difference of
scale between the level of atoms and that of the whole body is to note that
there are more atoms in the body than stars in the visible universe. When you
contemplate the deep field view of the Hubble (see [Chapter 1](book-
part1.html#CT-bp-1)) and the sheer immensity of the known universe, remember
that from the viewpoint of a single atom, our bodies are also as immense as
the universe. The differences of scale are truly vast and, as it happens,
organisms are roughly in the middle with about as many scales below them as
above them (Figure 2.2).

![](../Images/17624fig2_2.png)

Figure 2.2

Scales from the tiniest subatomic particles to the whole observable universe.
On the logarithmic scale used here, man lies roughly midway between the
smallest subatomic particles and a whole galaxy
(<http://hendrix2.uoregon.edu/~imamura/123/lecture-1/lecture-1.html>).

Levels and scales are not the same. Scale refers to the dimensions and
boundaries of a chosen subset of nature. Level refers to (often roughly)
distinct forms of organisation. The difference can be appreciated by noting
that some organisms lack some of the levels I have listed. For example, in
unicellular organisms the cell and the organism are the same. Organisms exist
at a large range of scales, from the smallest bacterium4 at around 0.4 µm to a
huge elephant of about 4 m. This range is ten million. Clearly, then, the
scale of a bacterium is very different from that of an elephant, even though
both are complete organisms: 1021 bacteria could fit into the body size of an
elephant. This may surprise you. Even more surprising, there is more biomass
on the Earth in the form of bacteria and other unicellular organisms than in
the whole of the rest of the animal and plant kingdoms. There are more
bacteria in your and my bodies than we have human cells. They are essential to
our functioning as humans. This is a form of inter-dependence of organisms,
more usually in co-operation than in competition (Figure 2.3).

![](../Images/17624fig2_3.png)

Figure 2.3

Levels of organisation in biology. The level of the cell is highlighted as
particularly significant. The reasons for that view will be explored in
[Chapter 4](book-part4.html#CT-bp-4) (Adapted from
<http://easysn.wikispaces.com/ANATOMY>).

Scale is a more neutral description than level since it does not depend on
organisation, even though different forms of organisation occur at the
different scales. By contrast, the concept of level depends precisely on what
we identify as forms of organisation. The level of cells depends on the form
of organisation we call a cell, which is viewed as being above the level of
molecules and, in multicellular organisms, below that of the whole organism.

The concept of level is therefore a metaphysical one using the metaphors of up
and down. In fact, the ‘lowest’ levels – atoms and molecules – are everywhere
in the body. Just as there is no centre of the universe, there is no ‘real’
central or privileged level of the body, and no literal bottom or top either.
If you see an analogy here with Cardinal Nicholas of Cusa's fifteenth-century
insight ([Chapter 1](book-part1.html#CT-bp-1)) ‘the world will have its centre
everywhere and circumference nowhere’, you have already begun to understand a
major message of this book.

By the way, this point is quite different from the question of whether there
are anatomical centres, tops and bottoms. Of course, there are, at least by
convention. Gravity ensures that my head is conventionally regarded as above
my feet. This would not be a natural metaphor in deep space. Yet it would
still be correct to say that my body is at a larger scale than my cells or my
molecules.

One of the problems of the way in which twentieth-century biology was
frequently presented to the public was to mistake the metaphors of up and down
– and many other metaphors – for reality. This has also been a problem for
scientists themselves, since many were taken in by their own rhetoric, and
many still are. The result has been a biological science version of the
illusion that there is a centre of the universe. In biology this illusory
centre is often supposed to be DNA molecules, as the repository of genes. When
discovering the structure of DNA, Francis Crick famously announced to his
drinking companions in a Cambridge tavern that he had discovered the ‘secret
of life’. The director of his Institute, Max Perutz, was rather more careful
than Crick when he said that DNA was the ‘score of life’. That is more correct
since a musical score does nothing until it is played. DNA does nothing until
activated to do so.

The illusion has become so strong that many people think we know exactly what
a gene is and how genes control the body. Those are also illusions. Recent
experimental work in biological science has deconstructed the idea of a gene,
and an important message of this book is that it has thereby dethroned the
gene as a uniquely privileged level of causation.5 As we will see, genes,
defined as DNA sequences, are indeed essential, but not in the way in which
they are often portrayed. They are passive, not active, causes. That important
difference will become clearer in later chapters of this book.

Metaphors are colourful and convenient, and it would be hard for biological
scientists to work without the idea of levels and the associated metaphors of
up and down, but we must keep in mind that these are just metaphors and that
nature does not need to follow the way in which we classify it. What is
convenient to enable us to think about and classify nature is not necessarily
a sure guide to the way in which nature works. The application of the concept
of levels to biology is just as necessary but also just as metaphysical as the
application of Euclidean geometry to space. It can be just as incomplete or
even wrong. With those points in mind, let's look at the nature of the various
biological levels.

### Atoms and Ions

Organisms are constructed from some of the same atoms as physical systems.
Atoms consist of a nucleus made from the particles protons and neutrons.
Protons carry a positive charge, while neutrons carry no charge. Different
atoms contain different numbers of protons and neutrons, collectively called
nucleons. That is what makes the difference between the simplest atom
hydrogen, with one proton, and, for example, sodium, with usually 23 nucleons,
11 of which are protons. It is the proton number that determines the
classification since it also determines the number of electrons, which are
needed to match the charge of the protons, and the electrons in turn determine
the chemical properties. The proton count is also called the atomic number.

Atoms have chemical properties that depend on the atomic number. The Russian
scientist Dmitri Mendeleev, working in St. Petersburg, showed in 1869 that
atoms could be arranged into a table displaying periods and groups such that
their properties could be predicted from their position in the table. This
system is called the periodic table and it remains the one used today to
classify atoms, although we now know about twice as many types of atoms as
were known in Mendeleev's time. The principle of his table remains valid. The
atomic number and its position in the table give a good guide to the kinds of
interactions an atom can take part in (Figure 2.4).

![](../Images/17624fig2_4.png)

Figure 2.4

Part of the periodic table showing the elements found in living organisms in
the lower-weight region of the table (adapted from:
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Periodic_table_(nutritional_elements)>).

The number of nuclear particles of stable atoms can range up to nearly 238 (92
protons), which is the number at which we reach the unstable atom uranium.6
The most common atoms found in living systems are much smaller. Just six
relatively small atoms – hydrogen (1), carbon (6), nitrogen (7), oxygen (8),
phosphorus (15) and sulphur (16) – account for 97% of the weight of the human
body. These atoms are used over and over again in almost all the molecules of
living systems, including DNA, RNA and proteins. Hydrogen provides the largest
fraction of atoms in an organism, around 63% in a human. It is also the most
common element in the universe.

In much smaller quantities there are the atoms that form the charged ions:
sodium (11), potassium (19), chlorine (17), calcium (20) and magnesium (12).
These five atoms account for nearly all the remaining 3% of matter in an
organism. Other larger atoms are present only in very small (trace)
quantities. One of these is iron (26), which is essential in proteins like
haemoglobin, which transports oxygen around the body. A few others, like
manganese (25), cobalt (27), copper (29), zinc (30), selenium (34), molybdenum
(42) and iodine (53), are also essential to form some of the enzymes (active
protein catalysts) of the body, and they also occur only in trace quantities.
But they may have been essential for the origins of life on earth (see RNA and
Other Early Worlds? in [Chapter 4](book-part4.html#CT-bp-4)). Other elements
are found in even tinier amounts, but are not thought to play a physiological
role. Many of them are harmful.

The body is therefore formed of very large numbers of a few of the most common
small atoms in the universe, with a tiny sprinkling of a few larger atoms that
play a role in enabling certain key molecules to perform their special
functions. Think of a pancake made from flour, water, eggs and oil, which form
the great bulk of the dish, and then a small seasoning of pepper and salt and
other spices. You then have a culinary comparison. A little spice goes a long
way. A few enzymes using heavy metal atoms are sufficient for living systems
based on DNA to function.

The positively charged nucleus of an atom is balanced electrically by a cloud
of surrounding smaller particles called electrons. Remember from [Chapter
1](book-part1.html#CT-bp-1) that these particles, like all particles, also
function as waves and that the energy jumps that electrons can make are
quantal. A cloud of electrons is therefore a good description: we cannot know
where any particular one is until it is detected by an instrument. All the
chemical interactions depend on the outermost electrons in the cloud, the
outer shell. Electrons in this shell can jump out of or into it. For example,
common salt – sodium chloride – forms by the sodium atom losing an electron to
become a positive sodium ion, while the chlorine atom gains one to become a
negative chloride ion. Sodium chloride forms most of the salt in the sea, and
since organisms first evolved in seawater the cells of the body exist in
saltwater, reflecting the amounts that were in the sea during the origin of
life. The salt composition of the inside of cells, however, is very different,
as we will see later. The main positive ion inside is potassium. Sodium is
held at a much lower concentration. Calcium is even lower still. These details
are very important for the functioning of living cells. The gradients between
the inside and outside can be used as sources of stored energy.

As I have already noted, most of the universe is made of hydrogen, either as
the atom itself or just its nucleus – a single proton forming the hydrogen
ion. The hydrogen ion also plays an important role in organisms. The amount of
free protons in any region of the body determines what is called its acidity.
Acidity (also referred to as pH) is an important property of living systems
and has to be controlled within narrow limits for everything to function well.
So, too, is temperature, which represents the amount of kinetic (moving)
energy the atoms have. High temperature represents a lot of movement, low
temperature less movement. In many organisms, temperature is also carefully
controlled within narrow limits. As we will see, these controls are part of
what make living organisms special. It is not the atoms themselves which make
organisms special, it is how they are arranged and controlled that defines a
living organism. The quantities of many other ions and molecules are also
controlled within certain limits. Organisms can detect what the levels are and
use this to determine whether to raise or lower the levels.

Physicists have revealed that the particles of atomic nuclei, i.e. protons and
neutrons, are themselves composed of even more fundamental particles.
Biologists are generally not concerned with these since we are fairly certain
that they never operate independently of atoms in biology. Nevertheless, this
fact is important when considering the question of whether there really is a
‘lowest’ level from which all biological causation begins. We need to remember
that below neutrons and protons there are quarks, gluons, etc. This is an
inconvenient fact for those who think that it is somehow obvious that the
bottom (causal?) level in biology is that of atoms or molecules. Why should we
stop at those levels? And who knows whether physics has already reached what
may be the ‘real’ bottom level.

Nor is it evident how any such ‘reality’ would help. As we saw in [Chapter
1](book-part1.html#CT-bp-1), at the micro level physics is described in
quantum mechanical terms where the concept of reality itself is in question.
The full reasons for saying that there is no ‘centre’ and no ‘bottom’ will be
dealt with in [Chapter 6](book-part6.html#CT-bp-6). Those reasons for the
change in viewpoint that I am arguing for are best appreciated by first
knowing some of the important experimental observations on the basic
components.

Before we leave the level of atoms, we should note that the particles that can
fuse to form atoms do so in the fusion reactions that can occur in stars,
which did not appear to light up the sky until thousands of years after the
origin of the universe (the ‘big bang’). A universe that did not form stars
would not have formed living systems as we know them. We are, literally,
‘stardust’. So is the Earth we inhabit. On current views it and we form part
of a vast process of unfolding from a tiny and highly dense origin, which
would have been completely invisible to the naked eye. But then, no eyes could
have existed at that time. Eyes, like the rest of our bodies, are made from
molecules, which are made from atoms. At the time of the big bang no atoms
existed.

### Molecules

Atoms are combined in molecules. Examples of these include water, which forms
more than half of the mass of a human. Others include the atmospheric gases we
breathe: oxygen, carbon dioxide and nitrogen. There are also many atoms that
are in the form of ions, which are atoms that have lost or gained one or more
of their surrounding electrons. These include sodium, potassium and calcium
ions, which are positively charged because they have lost one or two
electrons. They also include hydrogen ions, which are therefore protons, since
hydrogen has only one electron to lose, and the nucleus is a single proton.
Then there are negatively charged ions, like chloride. Sodium chloride is
common salt. But in the water environment of the body it divides into the
positively charged sodium and the negatively charged chloride. I don't need to
produce a complete list of all the molecules – what you will understand from
this is that most of the body is made of the same kind of ‘stuff’ that we find
outside the body.

But organisms also include many molecules that are not usually found outside
them. Some of these are molecules that many readers will know about from
popular science books and media programmes. These include proteins, DNA and
RNA. You will learn much more about RNA in this book and you may have to
relearn some of what you have learnt about DNA. Proteins, and the DNA and RNA
that form templates for the manufacture of proteins, are molecules called
polymers that are constructed from many small molecules arranged in long
chains. Amino acids form the chains in proteins. Individual nucleic acids
called nucleotides form the polymer chains in DNA and RNA.7 Nucleotides also
play a major role in energy usage in organisms, where ATP is a kind of
universal energy currency, and in signalling, where cAMP is used.8

There are also special oily (fatty) molecules called lipids. They play an
essential role in the formation of cells, which are the fundamental functional
units of an organism. The earliest organisms were single cells. In fact, most
organisms alive today are also single cells. Lipids are essential for forming
the oily membranes at the cell surface and at the surface of many objects
inside the cell. The oily nature is essential to the way in which lipids
function. Water and oils tend to separate, as any good cook knows when a
delicious blended sauce breaks up and has to be re-blended. The same process
occurs in living systems. The oily lipids stick together to form extremely
thin films surrounding the watery interiors of cells and organelles. They
naturally form thin membranes, just as oil naturally spreads in a thin film on
water. In biological membranes, there are two thin films forming a double
layer. That enables the membrane to separate two water-based spaces since each
layer of the double membrane has a water-loving surface facing out to the
water phase, with an oily surface connecting to the oily surface of the other
layer to form the very thin interior of the membrane.

The fatty molecules do not therefore form an oily drop, as usually happens
when we mix oil and water. It is hard to see how an oily drop could form the
basis of living systems since such a drop would keep the chemicals that
dissolve in oil separate from those that dissolve in water. What is needed is
a separate water space where the special reactions of living systems can take
place and where oily molecules can sit in membranes and allow their active
sites to be accessible to other molecules from the water phases (Figures 2.5
and 2.6).

![](../Images/17624fig2_5.png)

Figure 2.5

Double layer (lipid bilayers) forming the membranes of two adjacent cells with
an intercellular space between them. Each bilayer is about 5 nm thick. This is
far smaller than the wavelength of light (400–700 nm), which is why the
bilayers cannot be seen under the light microscope. The development of
electron microscopes made their visualisation possible (source: Bloom &
Fawcett 1994)9.

![](../Images/17624fig2_6.png)

Figure 2.6

Transmission electron microscope image of a lipid vesicle. The two dark bands
around the edge are the two leaflets of the bilayer. As in Figure 2.5, the
bilayer thickness is around 5 nm. Historically, similar images confirmed that
the cell membrane is a bilayer (Wikipedia, Sandraamurray,
File:Annular_Gap_Junction_Vesicle.jpg).

An important discovery on lipids was made in the 1960s by the Cambridge
scientist Alex Bangham. He showed that lipid bilayer vesicles (small spheres a
bit like a tiny cell – see Figure 2.6) form spontaneously when mixing dried
lipid with water. The lipid bilayers are fluid: molecules like proteins
sitting in the bilayer can move around. The bilayers are also self-healing. If
broken, the layer will reform naturally. These properties will be important
when we look in more detail at cells in [Chapter 4](book-part4.html#CT-bp-4).

Then there are many relatively small molecules called metabolites, hormones
and transmitters. The metabolites move around and interact to form the
biochemical networks that generate energy, and to perform many other functions
essential to life and reproduction. The hormones and transmitters perform the
functions requiring communication between different parts of the organism. We
will meet all of these later. Most of them also dissolve in water

These special biological molecules must have evolved in the enclosed space
since they do not naturally occur outside living organisms. Many of them can
be made artificially, and they can also be isolated from the body and
investigated scientifically in the same way as other molecules. The rules that
describe how they can be formed and how they interact are the same as those of
chemistry in general. We no longer think that there is a special kind of
matter or energy in living organisms. The nineteenth-century question of
whether there exists a special ‘vital energy’ only found in organisms was
largely settled in that century. The answer is no. However, we will see later
in this book that a distant relation of the concept of ‘vital energy’ has made
a comeback. Properties of biological systems include behaviour that only the
system can display. As I will show, these systems properties play a role
rather similar to the original concept of vital energy.

### Molecules as Systems

In this book I will frequently refer to systems. A system is a combination of
components that interact with each other. It is characteristic of systems that
their properties can be hard to deduce from knowledge of the components.
Often, those properties are surprising. This is not just true of organisms. It
is also true for molecules.

As an example, consider the most abundant molecule in an organism, water. It
consists of two common atom types, two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. At
the temperatures of living organisms, those are gases. Hydrogen needs to be
cooled to −253 °C to become liquid. Oxygen also needs to be cooled to a very
low temperature, −183 °C, to form a liquid. But as everyone knows, water is a
liquid at a much higher range of temperatures between 0 °C and 100 °C, and can
remain liquid at even lower temperatures when other molecules are dissolved in
it. Some of those molecules are very adept at lowering the freezing point.
This is the way in which fish and other sea creatures can survive temperatures
below 0 °C and even survive freezing. They can do so because some dissolved
molecules can also stop frozen water from forming the kind of sharp crystals
that damage cells.

The special properties of water do not end with the temperatures at which it
is liquid. They also include special ways in which it forms a crystal as it
freezes. In solid water – that is, ice – the molecules are further apart and
so ice is lighter than water. That is why ice first forms on the surface of a
lake rather than at the bottom. It is also why icebergs float in the sea. For
organisms that require liquid water to survive that is very convenient, as is
the fact that water is heaviest at about 4 °C.

A deep enough frozen lake or pond will have water at about 4 °C at its bottom,
where organisms can continue to flourish. Ice and water are also good
insulators, so the bottom of the pond will be protected to a large extent from
very low atmospheric temperatures. This is the reason why large lakes outside
the polar regions rarely freeze completely. Since the ice is at the surface,
it will also melt fastest when the atmosphere becomes warmer.

Water is also a good solvent, which means it mixes well with many other
molecules, other than the oily ones. It is ideal therefore as a base substance
within which other substances can interact. It is hard to imagine a living
system without the equivalent of such a solvent since the biochemical
interactions that form many of the networks of the body use water as the
medium within which the movements and interactions can take place.

Other molecules carry some water molecules around with them since their
charged nature attracts water just as one magnet attracts another. There is a
cloud of water molecules around an ion, for example, which is said to be
hydrated. In fact, any charged molecule will attract a water shell and be
hydrated.

These are just some of the special properties of water. Even though we know
that water is composed of hydrogen and oxygen, the properties of the molecule
itself are clearly characteristic of the combination. They are not the
properties of the individual components in isolation. Nor are they what we
might imagine if the properties were a simple mixture of those of its
components. The components interact and this interaction is essential to the
properties of the whole.

There is a common misunderstanding about this kind of interaction, where the
interaction itself changes the properties of the individual components. A
theoretical chemist might object to this idea by saying that once we know
enough about the physics and chemistry of hydrogen and oxygen we can use
equations to predict their properties in water. That is doubtless true, but it
is still correct to say that those properties emerge from the interaction. A
key feature of Biological Relativity developed later in this book is that
components are always and necessarily constrained by the whole. That does not
mean that the components do not continue to obey the equations of quantum
mechanics and of interatomic forces. This is a good example of what I mean by
a systems property, and it is a phenomenon we will encounter frequently in
this book.

It is clear that, even at the ‘bottom’ level of the molecules in organisms, we
are dealing with systems. Molecules are also systems. Remember this point when
I come later on to discuss DNA. DNA is also a system! It is not just a
sequence of nucleic acids. As a system it interacts with other systems in the
organism. Also, it is controlled by the rest of the organism in ways that will
be described in [Chapters 4](book-part4.html#CT-bp-4), [7](book-part7.html#CT-
bp-7) and [8](book-part8.html#CT-bp-8).

The properties of water are so special, and so important to the development of
life, that we naturally encounter another big ‘why?’ question of the kind
raised at the beginning of [Chapter 1](book-part1.html#CT-bp-1), when we
contemplated the night sky and the ‘why?’ question about the universe. Water
looks as though it was designed with life in mind. That is a discovery we have
made using scientific investigation. Can the same methods be used to answer
this ‘why?’ question, and all the other ‘why?’ questions we will encounter in
this book?

Many books on science ignore this kind of question by treating it as an
inappropriate, even meaningless, non-scientific question. Those that do
address it often claim that science can answer it, and that the answer is very
simple: there was no design, and no designer. I will show that it all depends
on what we mean by an answer to such questions. The principle of relativity
can also be applied to what we can know. We will see that goals can be
properties that emerge during the process of evolution.

Goal-directedness is therefore also a relative property. Goals are always
relative to some particular context, internal or external to the organism.
Goal-directedness is traditionally called teleology, but many scientists have
avoided using the term since Francis Bacon's great work Novum Organum in 1620
outlining the inductive method, which formed the basis of the reductive
approach in science. That has been interpreted to mean that scientists should
avoid teleology, famously referred to by the nineteenth-century German
physiologist Ernst Wilhem von Brucke as ‘the lady without whom no biologist
can live. Yet he is ashamed to show himself with her in public.’ Monod and
Jacob even adopted the term ‘teleonomy’ to refer to ‘apparent’ teleology.10
But interpreted as the simple and verifiable statement that the behaviour of a
system is goal-directed, there is nothing ‘apparent’ in the behaviour so I see
no reason to avoid the word teleology. The objection raised by many scientists
is that teleology must entail belief in an overall purpose in nature and
therefore belief in an ultimate intelligence, or god. In a relativistic
context, however, this is not the case. Teleology as purpose in the context of
a particular organism–environment interaction makes perfectly good scientific
sense; it is verifiable. An engineer has no difficulty in performing tests to
determine whether a man-made machine exhibits purposive behaviour towards a
goal. Biologists can perform similar tests to show that a living organism has
goals. The whole universe – or whatever might lie ‘beyond’ it – may have no
knowledge of my goals as a living being. They are nonetheless real, as are the
goals of a rabbit, an amoeba or a bacterium.

The reason why we can identify goal-directed behaviour in living organisms is
that we can understand the processes by which the behaviour emerges. Those
processes can be investigated and analysed scientifically. We will see
examples of that kind of understanding in subsequent chapters. Some ‘why’
questions can therefore be most certainly answered by scientific
investigation.

Could we do the same for the ‘why’ question in relation to a molecule like
water? The answer at the moment is no. We simply do not understand the
processes by which the fundamental properties of matter emerge that enable the
characteristics of water that are advantageous to life.

This issue will be taken up again in subsequent chapters and in [Chapter
9](book-part9.html#CT-bp-9) in the context of the relativity of epistemology.

### Networks

In this section, by networks I mean biochemical networks: the ways in which
the molecules of an organism interact with each other within their liquid
environment. Later in the book, I will use the term network a little more
widely.

Molecular networks can be just two or three interacting molecules or they can
be thousands, millions, billions or trillions. There is no limit to the size
of a network. Ultimately, the whole organism is a vast molecular network. The
problem is that, at that scale, we have little hope of understanding it fully
as a molecular network. Networks become complicated with even five or ten
elements and they certainly become difficult to calculate and understand when
they involve, say, 100 elements.

This is an inescapable mathematical fact, but also a practical one. Imagine a
knot made by intertwining two lengths of string. Even with just two strings we
can make knots that are difficult to unravel. Add some more strings and very
rapidly we arrive at knotted networks that defy even the cleverest at
unravelling knots. Understanding networks is a little like the problem of
understanding knots.11

What do we do when faced with such a problem in everyday practical life? One
way to deal with it is to throw the knot away and start again with fresh
string. Metaphorically, we ‘cut the Gordian knot’. Is there an equivalent
approach in understanding the ‘knotted’ complexity of organisms? The answer is
yes, and it all depends on levels.

One of the roles of the concept of levels in biology is that when too many
elements are involved at one level, it helps to try to understand the system
at a higher level. Just as the detailed workings of the processors in a
computer may not be necessary to understand how the computer implements a
particular program, so it is not necessary to understand everything at a
molecular level in order to understand a biological function. In fact, I would
go further. What may be impossible, because of sheer numbers of elements and
their interactions at one level, often becomes clear at a higher level. We
should try to answer questions at the level to which they are most appropriate
and then use that insight to probe down and up towards the other levels. This
is the approach that the Nobel laureate Sydney Brenner characterised as
‘middle-out’.12

Many biological functions are brought together at the level of the cell. The
rhythm of the heart, for example, is best understood at that level. So are
many other rhythms, such as circadian (daily) rhythm. They depend on networks
that involve cell properties as well as properties of the individual
molecules.

That is one reason why the concept of levels is important in biology. Biology
is not alone in this regard. Physicists use the same approach when they refer
to temperature, which is a global property of a system of elements, rather
than to the individual movements of all the elements. Pressure, pH (acidity)
and electrical potential are similarly global properties of ensembles.

### Organelles

The very simplest organisms, called prokaryotes and protists, have fairly
minimal structures inside their cells. More complex organisms have another
level in addition. The interior of their cells is packed with what look like
cells within cells. We call these organelles. They include the nucleus, where
the DNA normally resides to form the genome. The nuclear DNA is also closely
associated with nuclear proteins (called chromatin) to form chromosomes. The
nucleus contains many other molecules. It is not just a bag of DNA. Possessing
a nucleus is the defining characteristic of what are classified as eukaryotes,
the kinds of cells found in your body and in those of most multicellular
organisms. The only cells in our bodies that do not normally contain a nucleus
are the red cells of the blood. They are cells that have lost their nuclei, do
not need to provide energy for it and so are more efficient in their oxygen-
carrying role. They survive for around 100 days and, of course, they can never
divide and have progeny.13

The part of the cell outside the nucleus is called the cytoplasm. It also
contains organelles, sometimes many of them. In animals, there are
mitochondria, which are the energy factories of cells. Muscle cells which use
a lot of energy are packed full of them. The equivalent organelles in plants
are called plastids. There are also protein factories, the ribosomes. Some of
these are surrounded by membranes just as a cell is. Don't bother to learn all
these names just yet. This section is to introduce the fact that cells in
organisms like you and me, and in most other multicellular organisms, contain
other components that have some of the characteristics of cells. You might
well ask whether, if there are cells within cells, perhaps these originated
themselves from formerly independent cells. That is exactly what we now think
in some cases at least. This fact has major implications for evolutionary
biology, which will be explored in [Chapters 4](book-part4.html#CT-bp-4),
[7](book-part7.html#CT-bp-7) and [8](book-part8.html#CT-bp-8).

### Cells

Galileo revolutionised astronomy with his telescope and his observations of
the moons of Jupiter. Antony van Leeuwenhoek from Delft in Holland did the
same for biology with his microscopes and his observations on the fine
structure of cells and organisms. His work was published from 1673 in the then
young journal of the Royal Society, Philosophical Transactions, and it
revealed a world that until then was completely unknown. Together with the
work of Robert Hooke, who first coined the word ‘cell’ for the basic structure
of living organisms, he discovered the cellular structure of plants, animals
and microorganisms. Leeuwenhoek was also the first to identify an organelle
inside cells, the vacuole. Vacuoles are temporary organelles used for getting
rid of excess water. They grow progressively and then discharge their water
and any other components by fusing with the surface cell membrane so that a
passage can open up to the exterior. Lipid spheres in cells can fuse and
divide, just like soap bubbles. In a sense they are bubbles, but in water
rather than in air.

Leeuwenhoek's discovery of microorganisms was initially received sceptically
by the Fellows of the Royal Society, largely because it required a major
revision of ideas on the origin of life. The theory popular at the time was
that the tiniest forms of life, what we now call microorganisms, could form
spontaneously in the right conditions. His work established that organisms
could be single cells and that they divide to produce more cells. Life comes
from life, except of course for the first living systems (Figure 2.7).

as an example (J Physiol. 2014 Jun 1; 592: 2375–2379).

That was an extremely important discovery, but it leaves open the question of
the origins of life on Earth. We no longer think that life continues to
originate from non-living material. The origin was an event, or more probably
a long series of events, around four billion years ago. It does not happen
today, probably because, once established, living systems changed the Earth in
ways that may prevent it happening again. Living systems have completely
changed our atmosphere, for example, which did not have sufficient amounts of
oxygen molecules when life was first formed. The atmosphere today would be
toxic for early forms of life, and the early atmosphere would be toxic for us
and many other forms of life today. Organisms are continually changing their
environment. The idea that a particular environment forms a niche, within
which certain organisms can thrive, is only part of the picture. Those niches
were in turn often created by previous generations of organisms. There is a
circular form of causality between organisms and their environment. Circular
causality is a central feature of the theory of Biological Relativity. It also
applies to the interaction between organisms and their DNA, and between DNA
and the environment. In all cases the interaction is both ways. Organisms are
not isolated systems.

Hooke's reason for using the word cell was that, under the microscope, the
cells in a plant resemble the rows of cells for monks living in a monastery.
The analogy is a good one. A cell encloses a space with an outer layer, the
wall. In the case of a living cell, this is formed by an oily membrane
composed of lipids. Like a room, the cell has doors and windows. These are the
proteins in the membrane that we call channels or transporters, which allow
substances to cross between the inside and the outside of the cell.

I said earlier that what characterises living organisms is not the atoms of
which they are made, but how these are controlled. The cell membrane with its
proteins is one of the key controllers because the channels are selective.
They only allow certain substances to cross. The substances kept inside can
therefore be very different in their quantities from outside. The difference
can be very large. For example, the amount of calcium ions inside a cell can
be very small indeed, as little as 1/10,000th of the concentration outside.
The mechanisms by which these large differences are established and controlled
give living systems independence, a kind of freedom from all the vagaries of
the outside world.

Moreover, in addition to creating an internal environment that is different
from the outside, it is possible in a small space to produce and control
changes in the quantities of substances. To use the example of calcium again,
this ion has been developed in living systems to be the controller of cell
movement. By increasing the calcium level by around ten times (to about 1000
times smaller than outside) the cell can move from rest to moving. And it can
relax back again quickly when the calcium level is reduced. This is the
process that enables us to move our muscles rapidly and under fine control.
That would be impossible without cells. A large local variation in an ion or
molecule is best achieved within a confined space. Even within the cell
itself, local changes in confined spaces can be much larger than the change in
the whole cell. The intricate structure of cells forms the basis of very fine
control mechanisms. Control in living organisms depends on the formation of
compartments. Structure is one of the keys to understanding control in living
systems, which is why their anatomy – the study of structure – is important.
The information contained in 3D cell structure is comparable to that contained
in the genome.14 The nature and origin of cells will be addressed in [Chapter
4](book-part4.html#CT-bp-4).

### Tissues

For the great majority of evolutionary history, no tissues or higher levels
existed. The cell was the complete organism. Moreover, most of the organisms
alive today are single cells. In fact, as I noted earlier, most of the cells
in your body and mine are single-cell organisms: the bacteria that make our
gastro-intestinal systems work so well match or even outnumber the cells in
the rest of our bodies. Co-operation of this kind between species is
widespread. Nature is not always, nor even usually, ‘red in tooth and claw’.

There are many forms of co-operation between cells. Some species, like the
amoeba Dictyostelium, have life cycles in which they are sometimes free-moving
single cells, while at other times the cells aggregate to form a slime mould
in which the cells are no longer free to move independently. This can be seen
as a primitive version of a multicellular organism. Multicellular organisms
are cells that have given up independent existence. There are also ‘organisms’
that are two species co-habiting to their mutual benefit. Corals and their co-
operation with algae are a good example. Amoeba-like organisms called
foraminifera (which means organisms with holes) also co-operate with algae
that live in the holes in remarkable examples of what we call symbiosis: two
species co-operating. The bacteria in our gut also form just such an example.
We, too, are symbionts. As I have already noted, all eukaryotic cells owe
their origin to symbiogenesis.

Aggregation produces remarkable changes in the properties of the individual
cells. The whole ensemble determines how the individuals behave. This can be
seen in the slime mould, which behaves like a fungus or plant with a fruiting
body that enables dispersion of its seeds, called spores, to occur. The spores
eventually become new single-cell organisms and the cycle can then begin
again. As with aggregation of atoms to form molecules with utterly different
properties from the components, this is an example of a system, with
properties that are characteristic of the system (Figure 2.8).

![](../Images/17624fig2_8.png)

Figure 2.8

In multicellular organisms a tissue is a group of cells that function together
to form the building blocks of organs and systems. Cells of a particular type
aggregate to form sheets (hence the name tissue) and blocks of various shapes,
just as slime moulds form as aggregates of the individual amoebae. Once again,
the interaction between the cells changes their properties. Moreover, the way
in which this happens can vary enormously even in the same organism.

When we classify the types of cells in our own bodies, we can distinguish
around 200 different types according to the properties of the tissue in which
the cells find themselves. They can be as different as bone cells, using
calcium to form hard bone, and heart cells, using calcium to control the
heartbeat. Even the single atom calcium is made to behave differently
according to the system within which it finds itself. In one it is a building
block of a solid architectural feature of the body; in the other it is a lithe
controller, jumping around between cell organelles at high speed to control
the movement of the heart. In skeletal muscles it does so to enable, for
example, a musician to play accurately and rapidly. Think of a guitarist
playing a tremolo piece or a pianist executing fast arpeggios: on all of those
finger muscles millions of calcium ions are moving around very rapidly in
small fractions of a second. From a single-atom viewpoint it is impossible to
explain this. Calcium is constrained by the cells in which it finds itself to
behave completely differently. The ways in which wholes constrain parts is a
key feature of the concept of Biological Relativity.

All of the 200 cell types show differences that are as striking as this. Liver
cells perform biochemical functions that nerve cells do not, while nerve cells
have their own specialisations. Nerve cells communicate tiny electric signals
around the body, so helping to control its functions rapidly. If you see a
squid darting backwards at great speed to avoid a predator while also ejecting
a cloud of black ink to confuse the predator, the speed with which that can
occur is a consequence of a remarkably large nerve cell that conducts the
electric impulse to activate the huge mantle muscle. This is jet propulsion,
and it is an avoidance control system that would make any manufacturer of a
fighter aircraft proud. One moment the squid is in front of a hungry predator,
and the next moment as the predator opens its mouth to attack all it
encounters is a cloud of ink with no idea where the tasty squid has
disappeared to. In the case of some cephalopods, the jet mechanism can even
power long flights completely out of the water and through the air. When
nature is ‘red in tooth and claw’ it pays to be that quick, and adding a
‘disappearing act’ to the trick can be the difference between life and
death.15

There are many more examples of such specialisations in cells. But now we come
to the truly remarkable fact about these specialisations. All of these cells
in our body have almost exactly the same DNA in their genomes! That should
already warn you that it cannot be the DNA alone that determines what happens
in cells, tissues and organs. The same genome can be interpreted in completely
different ways. Some organisms even incorporate this principle into their life
cycles. A caterpillar and the butterfly it transforms itself into have exactly
the same genome. Some have speculated that this may also be an example of
symbiosis. The caterpillar and the butterfly are so different that,
conceivably during evolution, they started off as different species.16 Even
DNA can co-operate!

### Organs

The word ‘organ’ makes us think automatically of our own bodily organs:
hearts, lungs, livers, kidneys, etc. But to a musician it would mean the
instrument with many pipes found in churches and concert halls. Actually, both
uses of the word share the Latin and Greek origin, which means an instrument,
something used for a particular purpose. The concept of a functional goal is
an essential part of the concept of an organ.

An organism is a complete system of organs, each used by the organism to do a
specific set of jobs. What provides that purpose is often seen as a
contentious question. Biologists and philosophers have had great difficulty
answering it. How can purposive, living organisms develop from inanimate
purposeless atoms and molecules?

As we develop the idea of Biological Relativity it will become clear that part
of the problem is that the question of purpose or function depends on the
level we are considering. It has no meaning below the level at which the
relevant function is integrated. As an example, consider the heart in
vertebrate bodies like our own. In the context of the organism as a whole it
is now obviously true that one purpose of the heart is to pump blood around
the body to keep all the cells and tissues supplied with oxygen and energy.
That has been clear ever since William Harvey's experiments in the seventeenth
century demonstrating the circulation of the blood and the role of the
movements of the heart in ensuring that circulation. But it is equally clear
that at the level of the atoms and molecules that form the heart, there seems
to be no such purpose. Those atoms and molecules are the same as others in the
body that do not form the heart. The purpose is not therefore intrinsic to the
molecules. If one insists that all causation in biological systems is
molecular, then there is no ‘real’ purpose anywhere in the body. This is the
origin of the claim by some scientists that nature is blind to purpose and
that evolution must also be so. Yet, we also know that the heart would not
exist if it did not serve its purpose.

Resolving this apparent conflict between molecular and higher-level views
requires a fully relativistic theory of biology in which questions can be
answered at a level that permits the question itself to be meaningful. There
is no point in trying to answer a question at a level where it is meaningless.
Different questions are appropriate at the different levels. In particular, it
isn't possible to understand the interaction of multiple components if you
only ever study a single one in isolation.

In the hierarchy of levels we are discussing here it is natural to place
organs at a high level, above cells and tissues. But before we explore that
aspect, it is important to recognise that all organisms have organs, even if
they are single-cell organisms. That is why the various components inside
cells, like mitochondria, ribosomes and vacuoles, are called organelles, which
means little organs. The nucleus is also an organ in this sense. Even more
importantly for our story, so is DNA. Like other organs, it is used by the
organism for a particular purpose. It was the Nobel Prize-winning plant
biologist Barbara McClintock who first described the genome as an ‘organ of
the cell’ in 1983. The full reasons for her insight will become clear in
[Chapters 6](book-part6.html#CT-bp-6) and [7](book-part7.html#CT-bp-7) of this
book.

The word organ therefore includes the concept of purpose, what the organ is
for.

There are organs, in this general sense, at all levels of biological
organisation (and notice the appearance of ‘organ’ also in that word). This
should warn us that nature doesn't need to pay too much attention to our ways
of classifying her. When we come to develop the full principle of Biological
Relativity, this fact will become very important.

### Whole-Body Systems

The term ‘systems biology’ rapidly became a buzz phrase during the first
decade of this century. Before the year 2000 it was rarely used, although the
word ‘systems’ was used in a related sense in ‘systems physiology’, and in
‘systems engineering’, ‘systems theory’ and other related disciplines. Why did
this development happen so quickly? In part, it was a reaction to a great
achievement, the sequencing of the complete human genome. There were a lot of
surprises arising from that work. One of them was that people realised that
sequencing the genome would not be sufficient to answer the question ‘what is
life?’. A new approach was needed. Having smashed Humpty-Dumpty into billions
of pieces – all those molecules forming genes and proteins – the time had come
to work out how to put him together again. This necessarily requires building
up rather than breaking down, integration to complement reduction. This is
what systems biology is about. But the systems approach is not new. The word
‘systems’ has a long history in physiology. The various organs of the body
form parts of whole-body physiological systems within which their function is
defined and implemented. The new generation of ‘systems biologists’ has tended
to ignore this use of the term ‘system’, and to focus on the biochemical
networks inside cells. It is an important message of this book that this is a
limitation. Many of the properties of biochemical networks cannot be fully
understood without understanding their functions within the large systems
extending throughout the body. Those systems contain the networks, cells and
organs to achieve the goal of the system. In this part of the chapter I will
briefly summarise the characteristics of these whole-body systems and how
individual organs form parts of those systems.

##### Circulatory System

This is also an example of extensive co-operation. To remain alive, all cells
need to be within about 50 µm of flowing blood from which they can receive
oxygen and to which they give up carbon dioxide. As tissues grow in size so
must the vascular system. A process called angiogenesis ensures this. The
vascular network literally grows into all the new tissue. Individual cells in
the system must be receiving control signals from the tissues and organs of
the body.

The heart is a central part of the circulatory system. It pumps blood into
arteries, which then feed the blood into smaller and smaller branches as they
fan out across the whole body. The smallest branches are called arterioles (a
diminutive term, rather like the use of the word organelles for the tiny
‘organs’ inside cells). These lead into the tiniest vessels of all, the
capillaries. These are so small that the cells of the blood, such as red cells
carrying the oxygen to the tissues, only just squeeze through. The Italian
anatomist Marcello Malpighi first observed capillaries in the lungs of a frog
in 1661. Like Antony von Leeuwenhoek, he was one of the first to use
microscopes to investigate the tiniest structures in living organisms. He
published his book, De polypo cordis, in 1666 in which he describes the
composition of the blood. Four decades previously, in 1628, William Harvey had
published his great work, De motu cordis, in which he demonstrated the
circulation of the blood, but he had to infer the existence of capillaries. He
never saw them. Yet his experiments and calculations showed that they must
exist. Malpighi's work confirmed their existence and that they were too small
to be seen by the naked eye.

After flowing through the fine and extensive network of capillaries, the blood
is collected through a set of vessels called veins that show a structure
opposite to that of arteries. Instead of dividing and subdividing again and
again, they unite again and again, just as streams unite to form rivers.
Finally, the largest veins carry the blood back to the heart to be pumped
through the body again.17

Each part of this system serves its function within the system as a whole.
Moreover, the properties of the system as a whole determine many aspects of
its components. The size and power of the heart as a pump, for example,
matches what is required in order to generate the pressure needed to overcome
the resistance of the branching network of vessels. This is the context in
which we can say that the heart, the vessels and the blood serve their
purposes.

##### Respiratory System

In a similar way, the lungs are organs that serve their function within the
respiratory system. They are the first step in the intake of oxygen by the
body and the last step for the expulsion of carbon dioxide. They are served by
a fine network of capillaries where the gas exchange with the blood occurs. In
fishes and other aquatic creatures, the same function is served by the gills.
In organisms like us, a separate blood circulation, also pumped by the heart,
services the lungs. These gas exchange organs form a network including the
chemical processes within the cells of the body that use the oxygen to create
energy and produce the carbon dioxide to be expelled from the body. The
complete system is called the respiratory system, and it also forms the
context in which it makes sense to talk about the functions of each component.

Lung cells and tissue grow into the space they occupy. When doing this, both
the lung and the vascular system show an interesting systems property that can
ensure the most efficient space-filling structure.18 In mathematics such
structures emerge from simple recursive formulae that can generate highly
complex and beautiful structures like the Mandelbrot set.19 Similar algorithms
must be capable of describing how lung and vascular tissues radiate and branch
as they grow.

##### Urinary System

In the simplest single-cell organisms, water is evacuated from the body by
temporary organelles called vacuoles. Clearly this cannot be sufficient in
multicellular organisms where water and other substances have to be expelled
through a separate system. The central organ in this system is the kidney,
which filters the blood in a highly refined structure of tubes that control
what is retained and what is excreted. Transport and exchange through the
walls of the tubes are the processes by which this control is achieved. The
output of this organ is then sent to the equivalent of the vacuole, the
bladder, to accumulate before being expelled. This also is a whole-body system
since it is controlled by small molecules called hormones that are produced
elsewhere in the body. These controls constrain the cells and molecular
structures of the urinary system to co-operate in the elimination of waste
products.

##### Digestive System

Similar processes of transport and exchange occur in the digestive system.
Unicellular organisms simply ingest their food by literally wrapping
themselves around it and forming a temporary organelle, a kind of vacuole,
which carries the food such as a bacterium or algae into the cell to the
organelles, called lysosomes, that contain the chemicals that enable the food
to be broken down. These chemicals are proteins that speed up the reactions
involved. They are called enzymes. In multicellular organisms the process is
more complicated. Early in the development of the organism, a tube is formed
running the whole length of the body, one end of which, the mouth, takes food
in while the other end, the anus, passes out the waste. In between the
entrance and the exit various kinds of specialised organs develop to break the
food down and transport it across the wall of the tube to pass into the
bloodstream. In humans, these specialised organs include the stomach and the
intestines. Surprisingly, perhaps, the process of digestion is not achieved by
the stomach and intestines alone. A wide variety of bacteria live in the
digestive system and help the digestive process.

In addition to the digestive tube (oesophagus, stomach, intestines, colon)
there are organs that perform specific functions connected with digestion.
These include the salivary glands, the liver, gall bladder and the pancreas.

##### Nervous System

All organisms are sensitive to what is happening in their environment.
Unicellular organisms have proteins in their surface membrane that can detect
touch and movement. Mechanical sensitivity may well have been the first form
of sensitivity as life evolved. An organism needs to know when it has
encountered an object or another organism. Variations in chemical levels can
also be detected. That is how an organism can detect where its food supply may
be. The surface membrane of a unicellular organism is therefore its nervous
system. The effects are transmitted immediately to the interior of the cell
and can be coupled to networks of interactions that generate movement. This is
a complete functioning system. There is a receptor on the cell surface, a
transmitter to the interior of the organism, and an effector, which in this
case is the mechanism that enables the organism to move. This three-component
system is the basis of all nervous systems. There can be many kinds of
receptors, many internal biochemical networks and many mechanisms of movement.
Even bacteria have this kind of ‘nervous system’. This is what enables them
and all organisms to show goal-directed behaviour.

In multicellular organisms the link between the three components cannot be so
direct. The relevant muscle cells will be located at a distance from the cells
that sense the environment. The answer to this problem was the development of
nerve cells. Nerve cells are like all other cells in most respects. They have
their organelles: nuclei, mitochondria, ribosomes, etc. But they also have
long extensions of themselves that reach out to interact with other nerve
cells and with the effector organs, such as muscles and glands. Some of these
extensions are like trees with many branches. The tree is called a dendrite,
and it connects with the extensions of many other nerve cells to form networks
of incredible density and complexity. The human brain contains tens of
billions of nerve cells, each of which may connect to thousands of other
cells. The number of possible circuits is effectively unlimited.

The problem of connecting with distant parts of the organism is solved by some
of the extensions being very long indeed. We call these long extensions axons.
They can be as long as the organism itself. There is a famous axon in the neck
of a giraffe that travels all the way along the neck and back again. There are
axons in your body that travel all the way from the top of your brain down
through the spinal cord to connect to a nerve that sends a shorter axon to the
muscles. Depending on the level in the spinal cord where the synapse occurs,
this can be a distance of around 1 m. For a giraffe those nerve axons can be
as long as several metres. With a diameter of around 10 µm, they can be
100,000 times as long as they are wide.

The advantage of nerve axons is that they can transmit very quickly. I
referred earlier in this chapter to the nerve axon in the squid and other
cephalopods that triggers the jet propulsion away from predators. The rapidity
with which the transmission occurs is due to the unusually large size of the
axon, which can be as much as 0.5 mm in thickness, and so visible to the naked
eye. Most nerve axons in our and other vertebrate bodies, however, are much
smaller and they achieve their rapidity of transmission through multiple
layers of insulating lipid membranes. This is yet another use that evolution
has produced for membranes. Membranes alone are very good insulators. Without
channels almost nothing crosses them. Even water and respiratory gases pass
through protein channels in membranes, not through the lipid layer itself.
Without channels, therefore, circular layers of lipid membrane are so good as
insulators that they can force electric current to flow along nerve axons and
thus ensure rapid transmission over long distances.

##### Musculo-Skeletal System

Organisms have many ways in which movement can occur within them and to move
themselves within their environment. Even plants display movement. Roots need
to burrow to find water and nutrients, stems and trunks transport water and
nutrients up and down from the leaves, while plants also twist and turn to
achieve maximum exposure to light. Unicellular organisms show a bewildering
array of motors of various kinds. Some swim by means of paddles called cilia
attached to their surfaces. This may also be an example of evolution by
symbiogenesis. Cilia may have originated from ciliate bacteria. Other kinds of
cells move by pushing out a protuberance called a pseudopodium (literally a
‘false foot’), using proteins within the cytoplasm to achieve the movement. If
the pseudopodium finds an interesting object that could be food, for example,
the whole organism can then move to ingest it by a kind of reverse process to
that of forming a vacuole. Instead of using a lipid bag to expel fluid, it is
used to ingest food.

At some point during evolution, some very useful long thread-like proteins
developed called actin and myosin. These form the mechanical working parts of
skeletal, cardiac and smooth muscles in our bodies. Actin and myosin are
formed as long filaments with regular protuberances that are used to form
bridges between them. Movement occurs by these bridges performing a kind of
rowing movement so that actin and myosin can slide along each other, as we saw
at the beginning of this chapter.

In vertebrates, muscles exert their actions through their connections to the
bones of the body. The skeletal system serves at least two purposes. First, to
give support to the whole body, which would collapse if it was composed only
of soft tissues. Second, to provide the system of smoothly articulating joints
that allow the muscles to move bones, much as a mechanical crane moves its
parts. Nature invented pulleys, levers, articulations, lubrication and gearing
long before the industrial revolution. It also knew how to multi-task. The
interior of bones contains a remarkable organ: bone marrow is where blood
cells and the cells of the immune system are made. As noted earlier, it is
also a remarkable fact that calcium plays such a different role in bone and
muscle. In bone it forms part of the molecules that make the dense crystal
structure to form the solid part of bones. In muscles, as the calcium ion, it
moves rapidly between cellular structures to control movement.

##### Immune and Endocrine Systems

The whole-body systems we have considered so far consist of discrete tissues
and organs, although their effects are distributed throughout the body. The
two systems we are now going to consider are inherently distributed. These are
the immune and endocrine systems.

The immune system is the organism's defence department. When attacked by
foreign bacteria or viruses or other substances, a part of the foreign object,
called an antigen (antibody generator), triggers the production of proteins
called antibodies that can bind to and neutralise the antigen. Since antigens
can exist in many different molecular shapes and sizes, this requires a
virtually infinite number of possible antibodies, far beyond what could be
generated by using inherited DNA alone. How the cells of the immune system
achieve this is fascinating and will be discussed in [Chapter 7](book-
part7.html#CT-bp-7).

The antigen–antibody interaction is a version of a lock-and-key relationship.
The structure of the antibody is a kind of negative template for the structure
of the antigen, so that they click together chemically. Substances that do
this naturally within the body itself are hormones and receptors. Receptors
are proteins in cells whose structure enables them to click together with
small chemicals – peptides – and proteins, called hormones, that act as
signalling molecules to activate or inhibit various processes in the cells of
the body. The hormones are produced by special cells in the body called
endocrine glands. They form an important part of the multi-scale interactions
between different levels of the organisation of an organism. Unlike the immune
system, the endocrine system produces a finite number of hormones with fixed
interactions with receptor proteins. By acting as messengers between different
organs and systems of the body, they are essential to the integrative action
of the body as a whole.

##### Integuments: The Body's Armour and Sensing System

Most of the simplest unicellular organisms are separated from the environment
only by their cell membrane, although there also exist unicellular organisms
that have specialised coverings, such as the foraminifera, which produce a
solid shell usually made of calcium carbonate. The rocks from which the
pyramids of ancient Egypt are built consist almost entirely of the compacted
fossils of foraminifera.

Of course, many multicellular organisms, such as the crustaceans, also form
hard shells. Other multicellular organisms form a skin of specialised cells.
The skin in organisms like us is an extremely elaborate system, with many
layers and components. In addition to forming a protective covering, the skin
contains various kinds of sensory cells providing the sensations of touch,
heat, cold and pain. The receptor parts of the specialised sense organs, such
as eyes and ears, develop from regions of embryonic skin, while smell and
taste receptors remain located in the inner surfaces of the mouth and nose.
The protective function of the skin is extensive since it is involved in
resisting pathogens, controlling heat and water loss and retention, and in
healing wounds. In fact, the skin is continuously healing itself since new
cells form to replace those that are sloughed off every day.

##### Classification of Systems of the Body

The classification of the organ systems of the body is not very precise. There
is considerable overlap between the different systems. All of them use the
circulatory system. The nervous system is distributed everywhere. Even the
intestines have a ‘brain’ formed by a considerable number of nerve cells. Your
gut instinct may well be less metaphorical than you might think! The heart,
too, has a nervous network associated with it. The old idea that the heart was
the seat of the soul may also not be quite so absurd as we have come to
think.20 The diffuse systems, immune and endocrine, are also everywhere in the
body.

Does it make sense, therefore, to speak about particular organs, such as the
heart and the liver? Of course, this is convenient from an anatomical
viewpoint, but much less so from a functional viewpoint. The difference is
nicely illustrated by the problems encountered in translating and interpreting
between different medical traditions. Western medical science has been
strongly reductionist in its approach. The word ‘heart’, for example means a
particular anatomical structure with a well-defined boundary, essentially what
we dissect out when removing a heart for transplantation. The oriental medical
tradition uses the equivalent word, which is the Chinese character 心, to refer
also to the system of which the heart is a part. This is a more integrative
view.

### The Organism as a Whole

All these systems function in the context of the organism as a whole, which
forms the ‘internal environment’ of the cells, tissues and organs. The
organism itself is a system. In the context of this book it also needs to be
emphasised that it is an open system. Causal relations between scales do not
stop therefore at the boundary of the organism. Those causal relations are
also two-way: organisms create their environment to some extent. We as humans
depend on that process for our very existence. We would not be able to survive
in the atmosphere of the Earth during the first billion or so years of life
here. We and all other oxygen-breathing organisms had to wait for other
organisms to create the atmospheric oxygen that we depend on.

### Beyond Organisms

Organisms are open systems. They continually exchange energy and matter with
the environment, which is what we mean by an open system. Open systems cannot
be understood without studying these exchanges with the environment, which
itself is therefore a causal agency in the behaviour of the system.

More complex organisms interact with the environment in other ways too – for
example, through social interactions within and beyond their own species. They
create the environment of the future by creating new niches which in turn
enables new forms of life to evolve to fill those niches. This creates chains
of organisms of different sizes and interlocking forms of behaviour. The food
chain is an obvious example. We would not exist without it. If humans ever
manage to colonise another planet, they would probably have to transport with
them the means of creating and maintaining a food chain.

### Conclusions

Understanding the organisation of organisms in terms of scales and levels is
an essential prelude to developing the theory of Biological Relativity.
Twentieth-century biology tended to fragment into different disciplines:
molecular biology, cell biology, physiology and so on up to ecology, the study
of organisms in their context, and sociology, where the context is social. But
this hides the fact that the really important processes that define living
systems are interactions between the scales and levels. As we have seen in
this chapter, although molecules have systems properties that would be hard to
predict from the properties of their component atoms, and even harder to
predict from the properties of fundamental particles, they are not living. All
molecules in biological systems on their own are dead, including DNA. Even
viruses, which are essentially DNA with some protective molecular structure,
are hardly living outside the context of living cells. Within the context of
life as we know it today, the minimal kit required to be a living organism is
found at the level of a whole cell. This is important because in all organisms
this is the level at which inheritance occurs. One of the important messages
of this chapter is that a cell is vastly more than its DNA, and an organism is
vastly more than a collection of cells. All of that ‘vastly more’ is passed on
to subsequent generations. The consequences of this fact for biology generally
and for evolutionary biology in particular are profound and we will explore
those consequences in subsequent chapters.

The Nobel laureate Jim Watson was more right than he knew when he quipped:
‘There are only molecules – everything else is sociology.’ Even a molecule has
a kind of sociology in its context, and organisms certainly do.21

The second conclusion is that the range of scales involved is simply enormous.
At the beginning of the chapter I noted that to a single protein filament of a
muscle cell, the cell itself would appear to be the size of a small city. An
even more dizzying expression of the scales involved is to consider the
smallest independent unit in cells, which is the proton (the centre of a
hydrogen ion). Its diameter is about 1 fm (10–15 m). If we could magnify the
proton up to the size of a cell, the edge of the cell would be beyond the edge
of the solar system. I emphasise the vastness of these ranges because we can
otherwise be misled by schematic diagrams that show the components of cells.
To represent single molecules, such as individual proteins, we have to draw
them much larger than they are for the diagram of the cell to be possible.

We are now ready to look at biological networks and how they work to enable
the functions of living organisms to occur.

### Notes

1 A similar view was expressed by Francis Crick in his book Of Molecules and
Men. Essentially this is the view that life can be reduced to physics and
chemistry. This was also the central issue between Max Perutz and Karl Popper
following his 1986 Medawar lecture at the Royal Society (see [Chapter 8](book-
part8.html#CT-bp-8)). Popper tried to convince Perutz that he was wrong in
thinking that a complete reduction was possible. The solution to this problem
is to realise that molecules are constrained when they are involved in a
living organism, in ways that will be explained in [Chapter 6](book-
part6.html#CT-bp-6). That constraint is a property of the system, not of the
individual molecules. Popper was therefore correct.

2 This limit is set by the wavelength of light. There are some specialised
applications in which the resolution can be increased to some degree, but
never as much as by electron microscopy; see

10 The term teleonomy was first introduced in 1958 by Colin Pittendrigh to
contrast with ‘teleology’, since the latter requires intention and foresight
on the part of an agent responsible for the purpose. ‘Teleonomy’ was meant to
apply when no such agent exists, the purposive behaviour was to be regarded as
a natural consequence of physical processes without intentionality. My view is
that organisms with intentions have evolved and can therefore display
teleological properties that can be assessed and measured, just as an engineer
can do in the case of a purpose-built machine that exhibits goal-directed
behaviour.

15 Notice also that the squid's struggle for existence, its ‘selfish goal’, is
based on extensive co-operation between its own parts. The metaphors of
‘selfish’ and ‘co-operative’ are level-dependent concepts. This fact is
particularly relevant to genotype–phenotype relationships. Far from the
selfishness of an individual being determined by its ‘selfish’ genes, it
actually depends rather on its co-operative genes. This will become clearer
when the language of ‘selfish-gene theory’ is analysed in [Chapter 5](book-
part5.html#CT-bp-5).

17 The precise organisation of the circulation varies between species. In
amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals there is a separate circulation to the
lungs, so the heart has two sides, one pumping to the lungs and the other to
the rest of the body. In fish and in many other organisms the arrangement is
different.

18 Technically, these are called fractal structures. The pattern of branching
is the same at all scales, which means both that the smaller scales resemble
the large-scale structure, and that space is filled very efficiently.

<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set>.

20 This statement requires a context to be properly understood. Physiologists
have unambiguously established that the heart can function without attachment
to the nervous system. The rhythm is generated within the heart muscle itself,
as described in the [next chapter](book-part3.html#CT-bp-3). The nervous
system regulates the frequency and the strength of the heartbeat through
release of the transmitters adrenaline (accelerator and force augmenter) and
acetylcholine (decelerator). The ability of the heart to generate its own
rhythm is of course important in heart transplantation, when it is
disconnected from its donor nerve network. My statement concerning ‘seat of
the soul’ is intended not to question the well-established physiology of the
heart and its intrinsic functions, but rather to warn against views of
conscious experience that locate it entirely within the brain. See [chapter
9](book-part9.html#CT-bp-9) of Noble, D. (2006) The Music of Life (Oxford

Clinical Neuroscience, J.R. Smythies, L.R. Edelstein and V.S. Ramachandran,
editors (Academic Press, New York; pp. 353–363). From the viewpoint expressed
in those chapters, conscious experience is a property of the body as a whole,
one of the most important processes in a systems view of life.

## 3 Biological Networks

In nature, there is no ‘above’ or ‘below’, and there are no hierarchies.

There are only networks nesting within other networks.

Vision

### Networks are not Diagrams!

Years ago it was usual for many biological laboratories to display posters of
what is called the metabolic network, showing the interaction connections
between the different molecules in a cell. This was almost a badge of honour.
Often lavishly produced by companies, they were initially quite useful. As we
will see in this chapter, metabolic pathways are immense. But when our
knowledge of them was restricted to a few key sub-networks it was possible to
‘know’ such pathways, just as a medical student is expected to know the
anatomy of the body. As biochemical science rapidly grew in the later part of
the twentieth century, that kind of rote learning became impossible. Nobody
today could draw the complete known metabolic pathway poster from memory. They
have become so complicated that even on large posters one needs a magnifying
glass to view the relevant detail. The more ‘complete’ of these posters would
now cover most of a large wall (Figure 3.1).

Figure 3.1 [링크](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/idey4ozebxa7h0l9elfxv/metabolic-pathways.png?rlkey=vkirsuvbb8wju78nnlkvbrjs8&dl=1)

The Roche network chart as an example of a dense metabolic network poster
(rotated).

Could there ever be an end to this increasing complexity? The answer is no.

Even the most complicated of these diagrams are simply two-dimensional static
maps of what is in fact a dynamic four-dimensional process. Furthermore, they
are not multi-scale. They simply summarise our knowledge at a molecular level.
As we will see, functional biological networks necessarily include
interactions with higher levels. So, how should we look at networks?

Any or all of the components of living systems described in [Chapter 2](book-
part2.html#CT-bp-2) can form networks. A network is simply a system of
interactions. It can be as small as two components interacting with each
other, for example to form a third component, but the word is usually meant to
indicate many more. Biochemical (molecular) networks were introduced in
[Chapter 2](book-part2.html#CT-bp-2). A good example is a metabolic pathway.
Metabolic pathways consist of hundreds of different chemicals called
metabolites. The interactions between them are speeded up by proteins called
enzymes. It is thought that before proteins evolved this process was carried
out by RNA molecules, which can also speed up reactions, though in less
specific and much less effective ways. In both cases the process works by
using the shape of the RNA or protein to bring the two metabolites close
together, so reducing the energy barrier to interaction (Figure 3.2).

![](../Images/17624fig3_2.png)

Figure 3.2

Lock-and-key representation of the way in which enzymes work. In this case the
two parts of a molecule to be broken up fit into the template formed by the
enzyme, which then influences the molecule to make it easier to break the
chemical bonds. The reverse process would describe how an enzyme brings two
separate molecules together to make them more likely to join. This is how
enzymes enable long strings of nucleic or amino acids to link together to form
DNA or proteins
(<https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Two_Substrates.svg>).

Each metabolite fits into the relevant shape of the catalyst. Proteins can do
this more efficiently than RNA since there are many more specific shapes that
can be made from 20 amino acids compared to just four nucleotides (Figure
3.3).1

![](../Images/17624fig3_3.png)

Figure 3.3

Diagram of a ‘small’ network. This network is called the glycolytic pathway
and has ten links, each one of which is enabled by a particular protein
enzyme. The links represent the processes by which glucose is broken down to
produce energy. There is no need to remember the details of this diagram. The
important details can be found on Wikipedia under the entries ‘glycolysis’ and
‘enzyme’. What is relevant to this chapter is that even small processes in
biological networks are complex in their details (from Wikimedia Commons,
Thomas Shafee).

Functional networks of this kind are the workhorses of biology. They mediate
energy transformations, for example from sunlight and food, and so enable
work, such as muscle contraction, glandular secretion or neural integration,
to be done. Sunlight is the main source of energy in plants, where photons are
absorbed in organelles called plastids. Food is the main source in animals,
directly from other animals or ultimately from plants. The ‘small’ network in
Figure 3.3 represents the steps by which the sugar glucose is used to create
energy in the form of ATP, so it is one of the most important biochemical
networks.

Networks in the sense I will use in this chapter can also involve interactions
between different levels. As we will see, this leads to concepts like downward
causation, circular causation and multi-level interactions of all kinds.
Surprising as it may seem, the lowest, molecular, levels are controlled by the
higher levels. Even DNA is controlled by the organism as a whole.

At first sight biological networks, formed from nucleotides, proteins,
membranes, metabolites and many other components, seem fiendishly complex. The
DNA sequences that form templates (‘genes’) for proteins number around 25,000.
The number of possible interaction circuits that could be formed by this
number is enormous, around 1070,000.2 This is not simply astronomical as a
number, it is super-astronomical. As we saw in [Chapter 1](book-part1.html#CT-
bp-1), there are ‘only’ about 1080 ‘atoms’ (actually mostly as elementary
particles, such as protons) in the whole known universe. It would take many of
the pages of this book to write the number 1070,000 down in ordinary decimal
notation.

We can therefore be certain that the evolutionary process cannot possibly have
explored and used more than a very tiny fraction of these possible
interactions.3 If we extend the number of components to include all the other
types of chemicals and structures involved, we just make the calculation even
more impossible to contemplate. No one, not even the best mathematicians in
the world, provided with the largest possible computers in the world, could
possibly compute such complexity starting with the molecular components alone.
Massive bottom-up reconstruction of living systems is a metaphysical
reductionist's pipedream, not real science. Yet many biological scientists
still think that it is the way forward. It is more like the search for a
needle in a gigantic haystack, comparable in size to the universe.

In order not to be misunderstood, I want to emphasise yet again that we need
the reductionist approach to biology. This is emphatically not a book deriding
the immense achievements of the reductionist approach. On the contrary, this
approach has successfully drilled down to identify the smallest molecular
components and their molecular-level interactions. But there is a big
difference between acknowledging this great success of molecular biology and
adopting it as a method, on its own, for unravelling biological complexity.
Pure reductionism will not work, precisely because it does not analyse the
kind of complexity organisms display. And, indeed, that is not how scientists
like me attempt in practice to understand living systems. We use insights from
experiments and theories at all the levels of organisms that we discussed in
[Chapter 2](book-part2.html#CT-bp-2).

We even use insights from work on the universe itself and from the weather
systems on Earth. How do we do that, and can we show that complexity itself is
not really an impenetrable mystery? Can we show that it is rather a
fundamental property of the universe itself? That is surprisingly easy. Many
complex structures form quite naturally.

### How Do Complex Structures Form?4

Imagine a universe in which all matter is completely uniformly distributed.
Perhaps it was like that when the universe was forming from the ‘big bang’
over 13 billion years ago. Clearly this is not the universe we now know. As we
saw in [Chapter 1](book-part1.html#CT-bp-1), it is full of strange objects:
circles, spirals, horseshoes, vast dust clouds of various shapes and sizes,
and of course the even stranger objects in modern theories of physics, such as
black holes, dark matter and dark energy. How did such complexity arise from
what may have been uniformity and from a perhaps infinitesimally small
beginning?

Incidentally, the big bang theory does not imply something from nothing. The
idea is just that all the matter and energy of the universe we can observe was
once concentrated in an extremely small space, represented mathematically as
what is called a singularity. What happened at the singularity or ‘before’
that we simply don't know, nor do we know anything about structures that may
exist beyond what we can observe since they would occupy a region of space-
time beyond the possibility of their light reaching us. We are not even sure
that, or how, time can or should be used in that sentence. All we can say with
any degree of assuredness (not the same as certainty) is that we don't and
perhaps can't ever know anything about that. We can speculate of course, and
many metaphysicians and theoretical physicists do that in theories of multiple
universes for example. But those deeper questions do not need to concern us
here.5

One answer to the origin of complexity is surprisingly simple. There are
forces between objects. Some forces – like gravity and the opposite poles of
magnets – attract, while others – like the positive poles of two magnets –
repel. If we could turn the clock back and distribute the matter of the
universe evenly, the particles would immediately start their dance of
attraction and repulsion. As they do so they inevitably form networks of
interactions. No particle would initially be in a privileged position, but as
they attract each other they would congregate to form clumps. Once that
happens we break the symmetry of a perfectly uniform universe. Those clumps
would form initially as clouds and then as stars and planets.6

Breaking symmetry in an unstable system is easy. Small chance events can do
the trick. Imagine a ball placed exactly at the top of a hill with a shallow
enough top for the ball to have the possibility of staying put. It might stay
there indefinitely if there were no chance perturbations. But the slightest
wind would displace it from the peak and it would start to roll downhill, all
the way if it encounters no insuperable obstacles. Depending on how fine the
slope is at the top, it may initially move extremely slowly, but then more
rapidly as it experiences steeper slopes. On the way that rolling ball may
trigger many other events, such as landslides, that may in turn kill
unsuspecting climbers, in turn disturbing their family and friendship
structures…the list is endless. Once symmetry has broken, further events can
occur simply because of the energy and matter gradients that form, and the
chance encounter with other events and situations. There is a continual
‘becoming’, described by some philosophers as conditioned arising. These are
processes with ever more possibilities arising, because each arising forms the
conditions for many others. Conditioned arising is a key feature of Biological
Relativity, as we will see in [Chapter 6](book-part6.html#CT-bp-6).

Depending on the nature of the landscape at each stage, subsequent movement
will be predictable only with indefinitely large accuracy in the constants,
and in the initial and boundary conditions which specify the landscape. We
will encounter the use of the landscape concept in Biological Relativity in
[Chapters 6](book-part6.html#CT-bp-6) and [9](book-part9.html#CT-bp-9).

We can see this kind of process at work in the weather systems of the sky
above us. On a perfectly clear day the sky looks uniform as the apparently
evenly distributed particles in the atmosphere scatter sunlight to form the
uniform blue colour we see. But the stillness and uniformity mislead us. All
the time the atmosphere is exchanging heat, water and gases with the oceans
and continents. Convection currents arise as warmer parts rise and colder
parts fall. Water particles accumulate. The interactions between them form the
wide diversity of cloud structures, from relatively simple smooth planes, to
the fiendish complexity of a tornado. No one thing ‘makes’ the tornado. It
makes itself. The forces of matter under the right conditions ensure that
these structures should develop. As the complexity increases, so does movement
within them. They spin rapidly and rhythmically like tops. The movement in the
strongest tornados is so strong that they create immense damage as they hit
land and dissipate their energy in a frenzy of destruction.

From a distance above the Earth they appear as spirals. So do spiral galaxies
in the depths of space. These also rotate. Our whole galaxy, the one that
forms the Milky Way, is rotating, so we are rotating with it, probably around
a black hole at the centre of the galaxy. There are rotating structures
everywhere in space as well as on the Earth.

We don't need any abstruse kind of theory to explain these formations, both
celestial and cosmic. The equations of Newtonian motion suffice, although
relativistic effects must also be involved. A similar process creates these
rotating structures in both cases. We call them, and many other self-
sustaining structures of networks, ‘attractors’. The system tends towards
these attractors, which explains the name.7 Note also that no particular part
of the network is the cause of the attractor. The spiral and its circular
motion are properties of the whole network of interactions. They attract more
matter and energy to themselves. They are states of the network that attract
other parts of the network until the whole network dances to the tune of the
attractor. This is how a tornado grows before its accumulated energy finally
becomes dissipated in the destruction that it creates on land (Figure 3.4).

### Biological Oscillators and Attractors

The structures of the body form attractors in much the same way. Remarkably,
the structure and behaviour of a spiral galaxy, a spiral weather system
forming a tornado, and what we call a re-entrant arrhythmia in the heart look
very similar, although they are occurring on immensely different spatial and
temporal scales. To a single cell of the body a spiral arrhythmia in the heart
would look as immense as a spiral weather formation seems to us. And like the
objects hit by a tornado, those heart cells will receive an abnormal battering
from the unusual electrical signals that hit them while the arrhythmia
persists. An arrhythmia of this type is a kind of electric thunderstorm in the
heart.

Oscillators occur also in single cells, which in turn must look enormous from
the viewpoint of a single atom. And, as we know, the components of atoms,
their nuclei and electrons, are also spinning around. Oscillators are a
ubiquitous feature of the world around us, and we find them at all scales.

We do not need to look, therefore, for a further general explanation for why
oscillators and attractors form in networks of interactions. Networks whose
components attract and repel will automatically form these structures. Where
it gets difficult is explaining particular examples of oscillators. For
example, why do all cells in the body oscillate with daily rhythm, called
circadian rhythm? Why do hearts beat rhythmically at or around once per
second? How do they come to have such perfect timing, appropriate to the
functions they serve? It is when the question of function arises that we need
to probe deeper into what is going on. Something must be constraining these
oscillators to perform in a way that fits the ‘needs’ of the organism. Can we
find what those constraints are and how they arise? Those constraints are the
key to understanding the goal-directedness of living systems.

I put ‘needs’ in inverted commas because that reminds us that it is easy to
get trapped in problems of language in describing what we find in nature. Such
words can be seen as shorthand for a more long-winded way of putting the
question, which is how do organisms come to be adapted to the environment in
which they find themselves? There must be a process of interaction between the
environment and the networks of the organism to make this possible. To the
extent to which there is a ‘need’, what we may call a ‘meaning’ or purpose to
what evolves, it arises from this process of interaction. As I will explain
further in [Chapter 9](book-part9.html#CT-bp-9), it is the contextual logic of
a system that provides its meaning. People who tell us that there is no
meaning or purpose in the universe are wrong. They can only maintain this view
by atomising the universe, as though its components and their behaviour can be
seen as isolated. But the facts are the other way round. Nothing is isolated.
Even what we call fundamental particles are themselves also waves with
extension and interaction. Even at the ‘bottom’ level, therefore, there are no
isolated systems. Biological systems are no exception. They are all open
systems.

To explore these questions further, we will look at circadian rhythm and
cardiac rhythm as examples and see how they can be explained in terms of
interactions between some of the components we discussed in [Chapter 2](book-
part2.html#CT-bp-2).

### Circadian Rhythm

The dynamic networks of cells must have been attracted towards daily
oscillators very early in evolution. The daily variation in the energy
received from the sun would influence the energy supply, either directly in
the case of organisms that can absorb it as plants do, or indirectly by
controlling the food supply from other organisms. At the least, therefore,
networks metabolising energy would show a daily rhythm. In this case there is
a driver of the rhythm: the sun. Every day the metabolic networks would work
overtime. At night they would down tools and go dormant. Turning off the
energy supply is sufficient to make that happen. The real oscillator here is
the rotation of the Earth. Organisms sensitive to the rays of the sun then
simply follow that oscillation. They don't generate it themselves.

This is a possible simple explanation for how circadian rhythms began. But we
know that the circadian rhythm of cells today is not directly driven in this
way. Cells or organisms kept in constant light or dark conditions continue to
display daily rhythm. We humans show that phenomenon also when we travel
across time zones. Our body clocks continue to function as though the daily
variation is that of our place of origin, not our destination. Slowly the body
clock will adapt to the new light cycle, and that tells us that there is still
some influence of the original driver. But it is no longer the maintaining
influence.

What has happened between those early days of the sun being the direct driver
and the state of cells and organisms today, where the sun is more like a
regulator than a driver? The general answer to that question is that the
networks themselves have been attracted towards states in which they
automatically display a roughly 24-hour rhythm. The oscillator has become
inbuilt. We don't know very much about how that inbuilt property evolved, but
we can describe and analyse its mechanism in organisms today in very fine
detail.

In vertebrates, what neuroscientists call the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is
a group of cells in the brain that are necessary for circadian rhythm. It
contains around 200,000 cells. It has been shown with spectacular success that
the fundamental mechanism inside the cells of the SCN is molecular. The
feedback loops involve daily rhythms in gene expression level, generated by
further feedback loops involving particular protein and gene components. Even
single cells isolated from within the SCN can show these circadian rhythms in
gene expression.8

Mutations in a single gene (now called the Period gene) are sufficient to
change the circadian period of fruit flies. The discovery of this first ‘clock
gene’ in 1970 was a landmark since it was the first time that a single gene
had been identified as playing such a key role in a high-level biological
rhythm. At first sight this, and similar discoveries where knocking out a
single gene has such a dramatic effect on function, may seem to contradict the
view that genes must always act in co-operation to generate higher-level
functions. Is that really so? There are various ways of answering this
question.

Regulatory mechanisms are often complicated, with many different ways in which
they can go wrong. So if a single key component is damaged, and is not backed
up in some alternative network, the whole mechanism may malfunction, perhaps
in ways that are unpredictable. Most mutations, after all, are a form of
damage. Accordingly, when the absence or aberrance of one component is shown
to stop a system working, we have to be careful how we interpret this. When a
child tinkers with a toy until it ceases to work, it is not necessarily the
last thing she did that broke it. The more adult version of this scenario is
when a single bad connection in an electrical circuit causes a whole machine,
such as a computer, to fail, perhaps because we neglected to make the
connections sufficiently secure. It is obvious in these examples that the
fault or damage is not the sole cause of what is happening.

In biology, some gene mutation and knockout experiments are like that. The
results are difficult to interpret. That said, the case of the Period gene in
the fruit fly is interestingly different. The expression levels of this gene
are clearly an integral part of the rhythm generator. They vary (in a daily
cycle) in advance of the variations in the protein for which they form a
template (Figure 3.5).

![](../Images/17624fig3_5.png)

Figure 3.5

The molecular feedback process in circadian rhythm. Transcription and
translation of genes called ‘clock genes’ results in the production of clock
proteins, which assemble in the cytoplasm of the cell outside the nucleus.
These complexes then move into the nucleus, and further transcription is
inhibited. These protein complexes are then degraded, and the clock genes are
once more free to undergo transcription. The rates of transcription,
translation, protein complex assembly, movement into the nucleus,
transcriptional inhibition and protein degradation all combine to generate a
24-hour oscillation (from Foster & Kreitzman 2014).9

But more than that is going on here. The protein is involved in a negative
feedback loop with the gene that forms its template. The idea is very simple.
The protein levels build up in the cell as the Period gene is used as a
template to produce more protein. The protein then diffuses into the nucleus
where it inhibits further production of itself by binding to what we call the
promoter part of the DNA sequence. With a time delay, the protein production
falls off and the inhibition is removed so that the whole cycle can start
again. So, we not only have a single gene capable of regulating the biological
clockwork that generates circadian rhythm, it is itself a key component in the
feedback loop that forms the rhythm generator (Figure 3.6).

![](../Images/17624fig3_6.png)

Figure 3.6

Downward causation refers to the control of lower-level processes by higher-
level processes. Interaction between all levels can feature this kind of
causation. They include the control of cell activity through higher-level
processes that lead to hormones, transmitters and other substances acting on
the protein receptors in cells; control of gene expression by all levels; and
the control of selection, transcription and other modifications of genes and
their products, proteins and RNAs.

We call such networks feedback loops because they form self-contained
regulatory processes. Feedback is involved in the great majority of cases
where downward and upward causation are linked together in biological systems.
The linkage is a defining feature of feedback since the downward causation
modifies the components responsible for the upward causation, which in turn
modifies those generating downward causation…and so on. Mathematical models of
such loops are easy to construct and they are robust and explanatory. In some
cases just two coupled differential equations will do the trick.

Although the basic rhythm generator in this case does seem to be dependent on
a single gene and the protein for which it forms a template, we still need to
answer the question of whether it carries out its work in isolation? Is it a
‘single gene module’? The answer is a resounding ‘no’. The further researchers
get in unravelling the molecular feedbacks involved in circadian rhythms, the
more gene and protein components appear to be involved. At the last count, at
least 15 genes are involved.

This has emerged clearly from studies of circadian mechanisms in other animals
such as the mouse. Moreover, these rhythmic mechanisms do not work in
isolation. There has to be some connection with light-sensitive receptors
(including the eyes). Only then will the mechanism lock on to a proper 24-hour
cycle rather than free-running at, say, 23 or 25 hours.

It is impressive that a particular gene can be regulated by negative feedback
from the very same protein for which it codes. Nonetheless, we don't actually
have here an example of a ‘single gene’ function. But there is a more
important point still. Suppose that the original simple feedback between this
Period gene and the protein it is a template for had indeed been all that was
required. Even then it would still not have qualified as a ‘single gene
function’. The reasons are important in relation to the theory that there is
no privileged level of causation.

First, the protein that arose from the template formed by Period is like all
molecular components – it operates only within the context of the complete
cell. It depends for its production on the transcription/translation
mechanisms and the ribosome machinery. Its ability to access the promoter
region of the Period gene depends on properties of the nuclear membrane.

It is not only genes that never operate outside the cellular context. The same
applies to individual proteins and the networks they take part in. It is
conceptually convenient to ‘isolate’ the Period\--protein system. This does
indeed help us to appreciate its unusual characteristics as a molecular-level
oscillator. But this is an artificial conceptualisation. The real living
system operates only in the context of the functioning of many other genes and
proteins, and of structures for which there are no DNA templates.

Second, why do we call this the Period gene? Because it is a template for the
protein that, in feedback with the gene, generates a periodic function. That
certainly is the first function of this gene that we have identified. But how
do we know what other functions it is involved in? When a part of one system
plays a role in another system, the two systems are linked and can be regarded
as just one system. Perturbations of one will necessarily influence the other.
There may be varying degrees of modularity, by which we mean that some systems
are relatively independent of many others. I will discuss an example of that
when we look at heart rhythm.

But more often than not, what we perceive to be modularity is part of our way
of ‘breaking the system up’ to make it easier to analyse. That is a perfectly
good reductionist stance for analytical purposes, but we need to be aware that
it is not more than a convenient stance. Nature will not necessarily conform
to our perceptions of her. The Period gene has in fact been found to be
implicated in embryonic development as the adult fly is formed over several
days. And it is deeply involved in the male love songs generated by wing-beat
oscillations which are specific to each of around 5000 species of fruit fly
and ensure that courtship is with the right species. It would be just as
correct, therefore, to call Period a development gene or a courtship gene.10

Period is therefore rather like one of those very useful pieces of Lego which
enable a child to build many different kinds of structure. All ‘genes’ are
like that. Even when we label them with a particular functional name, they are
almost certainly playing a role in many other functions too. As we have seen,
many other genes are also involved in circadian rhythm. Each of them will also
be involved in other functions.

### Cardiac Rhythm

Are all biological rhythms based on these kinds of gene–protein–cell-structure
interactions? The answer to that question is: yes. Networks necessarily
include the structural components of cells. Must the network always include
DNA as part of the oscillator? The answer to that question is ‘no’, not
always, and the reasons are both interesting and important. Cardiac rhythm is
a good example of a network that includes DNA only as a source of protein
templates, not as an integral part of the oscillation network. If proteins
were not degraded and needing replenishment, the oscillation could continue
indefinitely with no involvement of DNA.

The basic rhythmic mechanism is generated by a relatively compact and tight-
knit network of proteins, while the genes that form templates for them are
used only to replenish the supply of proteins.

This network functions in the context of what is happening elsewhere in the
body – the activity of many other proteins. But in that context this little
modular system is sufficient to produce one of the most important oscillators
in the body.

Let's have a look at how the oscillator works in this case. The causal system
involved works both ways: up and down. The components alter the behaviour of
the system, and then the system in turn alters the behaviour of the
components. The system is the cell – a muscle cell in the heart. The
components are the protein molecules that channel the electrically charged
ions (of, in this case, first potassium, then calcium and finally a mixture of
elements).

The rhythmic behaviour is shown by the voltage or electrical potential. As the
heart beats, the voltage in the relevant muscle cells goes up and down. So
does the flow of ions through the protein channels. These two patterns of
oscillation are clearly linked. How?

The operation of the protein channels is essential for the critical rhythmic
activity of the cell. There is no voltage change unless ions flow through the
channels. That is obvious, and that is where we start. But it works the other
way round too. The rhythmic activity of the cell drives the operation of the
protein channels. We can show this by turning off the feedback from the
cellular rhythms to the proteins that channel the ions. If we do that, the
system as a whole ceases to function. Neither at the cellular nor at the
molecular level is there any longer any sign of oscillation.

Internally within the protein channels, nothing has changed. So if this
biological phenomenon were produced exclusively by bottom-up causation, there
is no reason why it should stop at this point. But it does. Clearly,
therefore, downward causation, i.e. the feedback effects from the system to
the components, is essential for the system to function (Figure 3.7).

![](../Images/17624fig3_7.png)

Figure 3.7

Computer model of pacemaker rhythm in the heart. For the first four beats the
model is allowed to run normally and generates rhythm very similar to a real
heart. Then the feedback from cell voltage to protein channels is interrupted.
All the protein channel oscillations then cease. The activities of the
channels slowly change to steady constant values. The same experiment can be
performed on real cells with the same result (from Noble & Noble, 1984).11

In Figure 3.7 the top trace shows how the cell voltage varies with time. The
bottom traces show how three of the protein channel mechanisms vary with time.
These include a potassium channel, a calcium channel and a channel that
carries a mixture of ions. There are more proteins involved in the model than
I show here, but if I included all of them the figure would become very
confusing. The horizontal axis is measured in milliseconds. The vertical axis
shows millivolts for the voltage trace and nanoamps for the current traces,
representing the activities of the protein channels.

In the first second (1000 msec) there are four oscillations of cell voltage,
and corresponding oscillations of protein channels. After four oscillations,
the feedback from the cell voltage to the protein channels is cut by holding
the cell voltage constant. If one or more of these oscillations of the protein
channels were driving the cell voltage, then they would continue to oscillate
on their own. But this is not the case. The oscillations of the protein
channels cease. In each case, the line that shows their levels of activity
flattens out. Clearly, the feedback from the cell voltage to the protein
channels is an integral part of the rhythm generator. This feedback is called
the Hodgkin cycle and will be explored further in [Chapter 6](book-
part6.html#CT-bp-6).

This example shows that, unlike the circadian oscillator, the components of
the attractor forming the cardiac oscillator do not include direct involvement
of DNA. Moreover, the circadian oscillator can also operate in this DNA-
independent mode. Knocking out the ‘clock’ gene in mice does not stop
circadian rhythm. So, the circadian oscillator system includes both types of
oscillator, with and without direct involvement of DNA. The cardiac system
also includes multiple oscillator mechanisms,12 but in all of them DNA is
simply a template for the replenishment of the protein components.

Two important conclusions arise from these findings. First, important
oscillators, necessary for life to continue, are well backed up by additional
mechanisms that ensure the rhythm is robust. It can continue to function even
when a major component of one mechanism is missing. The second conclusion is
that DNA is necessary for the production of the proteins involved, but not
always, or even usually, for the function itself.

Functional networks can therefore float free, as it were, of their DNA
databases. Those databases are then used to replenish the set of proteins as
they become degraded. That raises several more important questions. Which
evolved first: the networks or the genomes? As we have seen, attractors,
including oscillators, form naturally within networks of interacting
components, even if these networks start off relatively uniform and
unstructured. There is no DNA, or any equivalent, for a spiral galaxy or for a
tornado. It is very likely, therefore, that networks of some kinds evolved
first. They could have done so even before the evolution of DNA. Those
networks could have existed by using RNA as the catalysts. Many people think
there was an RNA world before the DNA--protein world. And before that? No one
knows, but perhaps the first networks were without catalysts and so very slow.
Catalysts speed-up reactions. They are not essential for the reaction to
occur. Without catalysts, however, the processes would occur extremely slowly.
It seems likely that the earliest forms of life did have very slow networks,
and also likely that the earliest catalysts would have been in the rocks of
the Earth. Some of the elements of those rocks are now to be found as metal
atoms (trace elements) forming important parts of modern enzymes (see [Chapter
2](book-part2.html#CT-bp-2), [Figure 2.4](book-part2.html#FIG-fig-9)).

### Gene Expression Patterns

The second important conclusion is that the existence of several functional
networks serving a particular function requires that the same genome can be
used as a template to generate more than one network. Two questions arise:
first, how often does that happen? And, second, how does the organism ‘know’
which to use? The first question is easy, the second is very difficult.

Let's take the easy question first. It can be answered by looking at the cells
in our own bodies. They display an astonishing range of types. They can be as
different as bone cells and muscle cells, or as liver cells and nerve cells.
As we saw in [Chapter 2](book-part2.html#CT-bp-2), a bone cell lays down
calcium carbonate as a solid structure, while a muscle cell uses calcium as a
mobile ion to control rapid movements of large numbers of contractile proteins
to produce powerful movements. A liver cell specialises in metabolic
transformations, while a nerve cell develops long, fine tubes called dendrites
and axons to enable rapid communication between different parts of the body.
That's four very different types of cell already with completely different
sets of proteins, what we call expression patterns. There are around 200 more
cell types in the body, with their own characteristic expression patterns.

We return to the astonishing fact about these very different cell types: they
all have exactly the same genome,13 derived from the same fertilised egg cell.
The answer to the first question, therefore, is that it is very usual for the
same genome to be used for very different functional networks as well as for
multiple networks serving the same function to make it robust. Our own bodies
are very good examples of that. So the answer to the first question is that
organisms use the same genome to establish and maintain multiple forms of
networks in different cells of the body.14

But nature has even more spectacular examples. The brilliantly coloured
butterfly gracing your garden with its agile flight amongst the perfumed
flowers was once an undistinguished caterpillar crawling up the stems of those
plants. They also developed from exactly the same genome. In this case the
whole organism displays completely different expression patterns responsible
for very different phenotypes at different stages of its life cycle. It is as
though the genome contains the templates for two completely different
organisms.

Some organisms even switch during their life cycles between unicellular and
multicellular forms of existence, as described in the case of the amoeba
Dictyostelium in [Chapter 2](book-part2.html#CT-bp-2). In a sense we all do.
Multicellular organisms revert to unicellular (the combined egg and sperm)
before the development of the embryo.

What, then, is determining what? Does the genome uniquely specify the
organism, which is an idea that many people think is so obvious that they take
it for granted? Or could it be that things are really the other way round, or
even a combination of the two? Perhaps genes are followers rather than leaders
in the evolutionary process. But that would be to stand standard evolutionary
theory, as many of us were taught at school, right on its head. This book does
exactly that, which is why I will discuss this particular question in more
detail in the context of evolutionary theory in [Chapter 8](book-
part8.html#CT-bp-8). But we can't demonstrate that fully and rigorously until
we have formulated the theory of Biological Relativity in [Chapter 6](book-
part6.html#CT-bp-6).

The difficult question I left hanging in the air is ‘how does the organism
“know” which network, which expression pattern, to develop and use?’. This is
one of the central questions in studies of embryonic development. The single
fertilised egg cell with, apparently, little structure divides to form many
cells within which, quite early, a polarity is evident: there is a tail end
and a head end that can form the context within which the rest of the
branching out into different tissues, organs and cell types occurs. I wrote
‘apparently’ because polarity actually exists right from the beginning, even
in the unfertilised egg cell. The fertilising sperm can detect this polarity
since it is easier for it to enter at one pole rather than the other. Symmetry
therefore breaks very early in development. As we have seen, that is not
difficult to explain. Symmetry breaking is a natural and inevitable event in
the universe. What is difficult to explain is the remarkable diversity that
then develops in multicellular organisms.

Not only is that diversity difficult to explain. The diversity amongst
different species is also still difficult to explain. We humans share nearly
all our genome with that of a mouse. With just a few differences, virtually
all the same proteins are made using the same genome templates. That is even
more true when comparing us with a monkey species. And even comparing humans
with a simple worm, like C. elegans, we find that we have similar numbers of
‘genes’ (as protein templates), which is between 20,000 and 25,000. There are
plants that have more ‘genes’ than we do. It could be that many of the
important factors responsible for the differences lie in the regions of the
genome that were once labelled as ‘junk’ – meaning without function – which
accounts for more than 95% of the human genome. That idea of ‘junk’ DNA has
now itself been junked as we have found that the great majority of the
sequences are transcribed into RNAs. Many RNAs have function within the
organism, for example in controlling the genome, and some of them are also
inherited independently of DNA. This takes us into areas of modern biological
science that are at the very frontier of current research. Epigenetic control
of the genome will be discussed in [Chapter 8](book-part8.html#CT-bp-8).

### Synchronisation of Oscillators: Brainwaves

Earlier in this chapter I referred to the roughly 200,000 cells in the
suprachiasmatic nucleus of the brain that are responsible for circadian
rhythm. The main oscillator of the heart, the sinus node, also has a similar
number of cells. Rhythms like cardiac and circadian rhythms occur also in
single cells, so why does nature have so many? When we isolate those cells in
physiological experiments they all display rhythm, but the rhythm frequency
varies from cell to cell. There is stochasticity at the heart of biological
systems. Stochasticity itself is important and we will return to that later in
the chapter. First we must ask the question: if all the cells are different,
how come that they all beat to the same rhythm in the heart itself? We can ask
the same question about oscillators elsewhere in the body.

As with rotating spirals in the universe, the answer is simple.
Synchronisation is a natural consequence of interactions in networks. This can
be demonstrated in many ways. I will describe just two here, one from an
inanimate system, the other from a living system.

Set up a few dozen metronomes on a table and start them oscillating
independently and completely asynchronously. What happens? Provided that the
table is not completely rigid, the oscillations gradually synchronise all by
themselves. There are examples of this kind of experiment in videos on sites
like YouTube, so you can verify this remarkable fact yourself. They don't just
synchronise approximately. They really do all come together perfectly
naturally and with no outside interference.15 Look carefully and you may
notice the tiny vibrations in the table as the synchronisation develops. But
even if you can't see the vibrations of the table, you can be sure they exist.
The physical properties of the table itself are allowing the individual
oscillators to communicate their vibrations to each other and so act as a
complete system. The more the table can vibrate the faster the
synchronisation. This is a good example of an emergent property. An initial
disorder becomes highly ordered through the interactions.

The same kind of mechanism works in the sinus node. About 20 years ago, when
computers became powerful enough to do the calculations, I collaborated with
two American scientists to perform a similar experiment on the computer model
of heart rhythm.16 We started the calculations with model cells that had a
range of around twofold in their natural frequencies. Then we gradually
increased the electrical connections between them. In the real sinus node,
these connections are formed by special proteins called connexins. Just a very
few such connections between the individual cells was sufficient to completely
synchronise the whole network. The real connections in the heart itself are
stronger than was needed, so there is no puzzle at all as to why a sinus node
beats as a single network structure. The same kinds of connections between
cells also ensure that this single rhythm is communicated to the rest of the
heart.

Coupling between cells can take many different forms in addition to those
mediated by connexins. Nerve cells in the brain are connected as networks via
tiny junctions called synapses, where chemicals released by one cell and
received by another form the links. These kinds of connections can be more
specific in their functions than simple electrical connections, since
different chemicals can be used at different types of junction. Electrical
connections are sometimes found in nervous systems, but the brain would not
work properly, or at all, if all the connections were electrical.

Connections to form networks in the brain must be responsible for the various
kinds of rhythms, such as alpha waves, that we can record from the whole brain
as the electrical signal called the electroencephalogram (EEG). ‘Brainwaves’
are not just a metaphor! The precise function of such synchronisation in the
nervous system is still a hotly debated topic in neuroscience.17

### Chance at the Heart of the Cell18

We come now to an absolutely fundamental question about the nature of
biological science. Is it really different from the physical sciences? If so,
in what way are they different? The great physicist and developer of quantum
mechanics, Erwin Schrödinger, thought that they were and that he could
identify precisely the way in which they differ. He gave a series of lectures
in Dublin during the Second World War after he had left Germany, disgusted
with the racist aspects of the Nazi regime. The lectures were published as a
book, famously called What is Life?. It is a remarkable book. Published well
before the discovery of DNA, he essentially predicted its discovery. He
realised that the inherited material containing the templates for the
molecules of living systems would need to be what he called an aperiodic
crystal. What he meant by that was a structure that repeats itself (that is
the ‘crystal’ aspect of his phrase) as a polymer but that the sequence would
have to be different (hence ‘aperiodic’) in different parts of the polymer in
order to be responsible for transmitting so many different inheritable
characteristics of an organism.

At that time, 1944, most scientists would have expected this structure to be
found in proteins, which is what he himself thought. Instead, it was found in
DNA sequences, which have precisely the property of an aperiodic crystal. The
same elements, the nucleotides C, G, A and T, repeat themselves, but most
often in a different order. That is what enables DNA to form so many different
templates for protein and RNA structures. I like the term ‘aperiodic crystal’
and it conveys an important message that will be revisited several times in
this book, which is that DNA is essentially another molecule in the body, just
as proteins, metabolites, lipids and other components are. Schrödinger's term
eventually gave way to the modern terms: genome, genetic code, genetic
programme and so on. The difference in viewpoint will become clearer when we
discuss the language of Neo-Darwinism in [Chapter 5](book-part5.html#CT-bp-5).

In this chapter, what concerns us is the question of the nature of physics and
the nature of biology. Impressed with the aperiodic crystal idea, Schrödinger
came to the conclusion that the difference was that in physics stochasticity
(randomness) at a lower level is always hidden at higher levels by averaging.
This is what enables us to use the equations of thermodynamics at large
scales, so that we do not have to bother with the detailed Newtonian mechanics
of every molecule of a system. But if inheritance depends on the transmission
of specific sequences in DNA then the behaviour of individual molecules cannot
be ignored in the same way in biology.

That is true. Otherwise it would not be possible for single mutations in DNA
to be responsible for transmitting diseases like cystic fibrosis, sickle cell
anaemia, cardiac arrhythmia and some others that can be shown to be traceable
to specific mutations in DNA. But what could not have been clear in 1944 is
that this is actually the exception rather than the rule in biology. Most
changes in DNA do not reveal themselves as a change in the characteristics of
the whole organism for the simple reason that organisms are very good at
insulating themselves against most changes at the molecular level. A
systematic study of all 6000 ‘genes’ in the yeast organism, for example,
revealed that 80% of the knockouts (deletions or damage of particular
sequences) are silent in the sense that, under normal physiological
conditions, the metabolism, reproduction and other important functions of
yeast are not affected.19

We see a similar result in humans. The surprising fact about many mutations in
humans that might be responsible for diseases is that the ability to predict
disease states from genome sequencing is actually very poor.20 In most cases
it is weaker than predicting disease likelihoods from family history and
lifestyles. In fact, we get much better predictions from family history and
lifestyles than from genome sequencing, and the most spectacular improvements
in dealing with diseases like cancer have come from changes in lifestyles,
such as reducing the prevalence of smoking. The same is true for longevity.
The contribution of heredity found in twin studies is only about 25%.21 Most
of the differences in longevity are attributable to lifestyle.

This fact is fundamental. To return briefly to Schrödinger's disgust with the
Nazis, the idea of a super race, based on a perfect inheritance, which was the
object of eugenics and which led to the disastrous Holocaust, is a political
fantasy. We couldn't succeed in doing it even if the eugenicist ideal was
desirable. The reason is that from knowing genomes alone we cannot know the
organism as a whole. Nor can we select for one ‘good’ characteristic without
the relevant genes affecting many other characteristics, the consequences of
which may be unpredictable and possibly far from ‘good’. In fact there are no
‘good’ and ‘bad’ genes. There are sequences. They are good or bad only in the
context of the whole organism, just as the meanings of words depend on their
context.

### Conclusions

In [Chapter 2](book-part2.html#CT-bp-2) we learnt that organisms have
different levels of organisation and that the message of this book is that all
levels can contribute to generating biological functions that characterise
life. In this chapter we have learnt that networks are a key to understanding
biological systems since all organisms that can be regarded as alive possess
complex networks. It is through the interactions within those networks that
functions emerge naturally. Those networks and their interactions are
necessarily multi-level. This insight is a fundamental building block of the
theory of Biological Relativity, which we will develop in [Chapter 6](book-
part6.html#CT-bp-6).22

All organisms are formed of cells, whether a single cell or many cells. The
cell (not just DNA) is also the minimal kit for inheritance. We are now ready
to look at some of the remarkable properties of cells and how they choreograph
the reproductive and evolutionary dances of their genomes. This is the subject
of the [next chapter](book-part4.html#CT-bp-4).

### Notes

1 The lock-and-key analogy is useful as a first approximation, but it needs
qualifying. Proteins are far from being rigidly fixed three-dimensional
structures. Many proteins can have several different conformations dependent
on other molecules and the whole environment in which they find themselves.
They can also have more than one function, a phenomenon called protein
moonlighting. Once again, it is the system that is important, and it can
constrain the individual molecules in their behaviour and structure. The
significance of this kind of constraint for the theory of Biological
Relativity will be explored in [Chapter 6](book-part6.html#CT-bp-6).

Peitsch (2005) Genome size and numbers of biological functions. Transactions
on Computational Systems Biology 1:44–49. The first person to identify this
kind of problem in biology was Elsasser, who called such numbers ‘immense
numbers’. He meant any number over 101000. Elsasser, W.M. (1981) Principles of

13 Actually, some genome reorganisation can occur after birth, and there can
be some maternal cells, amongst the cells that develop from the fertilised egg
cell, passed through the blood circulation during embryonic development. But
these exceptions do not change the fundamental point being made here. Even if
no such reorganisation was possible and no maternal cells were transmitted,
the result would still hold true.

generate different phenotypes in man is the pair of identical twins studied by

dynamic exercise on heart volume, contractility and left ventricular
dimensions. Circulation Research 48 (suppl 1):163–170. Body mass, respiratory

In this video the table movements are initially imperceptible. They become
more clearly visible as the metronomes approach synchronisation after about
two minutes. The speed with which the synchronisation emerges depends on the
elasticity of the table. A completely rigid table would not allow it to
happen, but complete rigidity is a physical impossibility. The table may also
have a natural frequency, in which case there will be resonance that could
amplify the effects.

22 There may appear to be an inconsistency between the general principle of
Biological Relativity (no privileged level of causation) and the statement
that certain levels (networks, cells) are key ones. This issue will be dealt
with in [Chapter 6](book-part6.html#CT-bp-6), where we will see that the
general principle is an a-priori one: we should not assume in advance of
experiments that any particular level is privileged. But we may find as an
empirical fact that some levels are more important than others in particular
functions of the organism. That is a discovery made a posteriori.

Science in 1997, on Carl Woese, the discoverer of the third domain of life,
archaea

### The Medical Histology Class

The characteristic aroma of the preservatives and staining chemicals in the
histology class at University College London in 1955 still echoes in my mind
when I see a histology slide shown in a scientific presentation. As students
we were allocated microscopes to view some of the classical slides showing
sections of cells, tissues and organs of the body. We tried to draw what we
saw and compared our work with that of the textbooks. Soon we were able to
identify the nucleus, the mitochondria and many other components of cells and
their connections to each other in tissues. Yet, what we were looking at was
not really a cell.

Years later I saw a film of a living unicellular organism, an amoeba. It could
hardly have been more different from the two-dimensional sections of dead
cells that I had drawn as a student. Nothing stood still. Everything was
streaming this way and that as the organism moved around. When it found an
object that was sensed (I assumed chemically) to be food the movements became
beautifully co-ordinated as two extrusions called pseudopodia (false feet)
encircled the object, eventually allowing it to be taken in as a membrane
coated vesicle to be digested.1 This tiny organism had a ‘nose’: the chemical
receptors on its membrane surface. It had ‘muscles’: in fact formed of protein
molecules, some of them very similar to those in our cells, only not organised
into separate muscular organs. It clearly had a ‘nervous system’ to connect
the two together, although it had no nerves as we know them. It had a clear
goal: to feed itself. As we will see later when we discuss the cell cycle, it
knows when and how to reproduce itself in an intricately co-ordinated activity
when it makes its genes dance as they and their predecessors have done for at
least one billion years.

Living organisms, even the simplest of them, are hives of such purposive
activity. Later in this book we will discuss this kind of natural
purposiveness. Yet, the amoeba has no brain to coordinate these movements.
How, then, do they arise? Could the secret really lie somewhere deep in that
nucleus? Could there be a genetic programme directing it all like the
conducting of an orchestra? That can't really be so because we also learnt as
students that there are functioning cells in our bodies that don't have a
nucleus. These are the red cells of our blood. We also experimented with
nerves that could still conduct signals to coordinate muscle activity. These
nerves had been separated from their cell bodies where the nuclei were to be
found and could continue to function for a day or two, much longer than the
lifespan of many microorganisms. There are other examples also of cells with
their nuclei removed that continue to function well until they need to
replenish their stock of proteins.

What is it about cells that enable them to do all this? The answer must lie in
the activity of the networks inside cells, but many of them must be entirely
outside the nucleus. It begins to look as though the nucleus and the DNA are
required more as an inner storehouse that can be raided when more proteins are
required, and which must therefore be passed on to later generations to enable
them to do the same.

### Cells as Carriages

If biochemical networks are the workhorses of life, then cells are their
elegant and elaborate carriages. Metaphorically speaking, of course, but this
metaphor has a grain or two of truth. For, like carriages, cells enclose,
compartmentalise and carry. And, like the internalisation of the engine as
horse-drawn carriages became automobiles, the ‘workhorse’ is also carried.

Cells enclose the biochemical networks of the organism since they provide a
cell membrane at the surface that may be used by various protein transporters
to select substances from the external variable environment to create and
maintain the protected and nearly constant internal environment where all the
biochemical actions take place. Cells also compartmentalise because, in
organisms called eukaryotes, there is a separate nuclear compartment housing
the genome, and there are specialised organelles forming further compartments
such as mitochondria, plastids and ribosomes, as we saw in [Chapter 3](book-
part3.html#CT-bp-3). Finally, cells carry all of these with them. In the case
of mobile cells they do so literally.

A moving amoeba, for example, transports the complete set of these structures
as it moves around. But even cells that do not move independently nevertheless
carry all the structures with them as the organism itself moves and as its
cells migrate during embryonic development. Some cells in our immune system
continue to have free movement even in the adult to enable them to attack,
kill and digest invaders. They are like scavengers cleaning the organs of the
body by first moving in the bloodstream to circulate to the tissue and organs
and then act just like an amoeba seeking food, but in this case their target
is material that is dangerous to the body as a whole.

Cells also have supporting architecture to hold their structure together and
roadways to transport things from one part to another. Astonishingly, the
structural skeleton and the roadways are formed from the same structures,
called microtubules. Minute building blocks of proteins called tubulins
literally form tubes that, on the scale of a cell, look like fine threads
weaving this way and that. It is the way in which these tubules and even
thinner actin microfilaments can move that enables the whole cell to move, as
in the amoeba example discussed earlier. These are the motors to enable
movements to occur. Movements generated internally arise from movements of the
internal microfilaments. But they also form the internal parts of cilia and
flagella responsible for movements by their whip-like activity on the surface
of the cell (Figures 4.1 and 4.2).

![](../Images/17624fig4_1.png)

Figure 4.1

Microtubules visualised in a part of a cell. Just as our bodies rely on bones
for structural support, cells rely on a cellular skeleton. In addition to
helping cells keep their shape, this cytoskeleton transports material within
cells, is responsible for cell movement and coordinates cell division.
Microtubules are shown here as thin strands. Each tubule is about 24 nm
across, but extends over distances that can go from one end of a cell to
another, which is many micrometres (from US Department of Health and Human
Services (public domain)).

![](../Images/17624fig4_2.png)

Figure 4.2

Microtubules (green) and actin microfilaments (orange) in an epithelial cell
from the lung of a cow. The tubules are about 24 nm across; the filaments
about 6 nm across (from US Department of Health and Human Services (public
domain)).

The microtubules are also roadways because substances can be attached to the
microtubules to move along them all the way from one part of the cell to
another. Special small proteins act as motor proteins that attach to the
microtubules to form the mechanism by which the protein can move from one end
of the microtubule to the other. A whole variety of other molecules and cell
structures can attach themselves to the motor proteins to be transported.
These can be RNAs, proteins, protein complexes, organelles and whole vesicles.
The roadways are two-way. There are motor proteins designed to go one way or
the other.

The existence of these roadways in cells solves an otherwise puzzling problem.
Cells need to inform their genomes in the nucleus which proteins to make. One
way of doing that in a highly specific way is to use the microtubule transport
system to carry information on the state of small regions of the cell, for
example just beneath a membrane channel protein, all the way to the nucleus.
Up and down regulation of genes can therefore be controlled in response to the
finest structural and dynamic features of cell activity. This was a puzzling
problem since some ions and molecules are used to signal many different
aspects of cell function. Calcium is frequently used in this way. The
information would not be very useful if it depended only on the global cell
calcium. Being able to detect changes specific to small regions of the cell
enables the same messenger chemical to signal many different aspects of cell
function. This is the way in which the genome ‘knows’ about fine cellular
structure and what is happening dynamically in all parts of that structure.2
Calcium, and other signalling molecules, are therefore a bit like traffic
lights. And, just like traffic lights, what is controlled depends on where the
traffic lights are placed.

Finally, microtubules are also the puppet strings that hold the genetic
material and move it around in the remarkable ‘dance of the genes’ that occurs
during cell division, as we will see later in this chapter.

### The Simplest Cells: Bacteria and Archaea

Not all cells are compartmentalised in this way. Prokaryotes are much simpler
and must have evolved before eukaryotes since, as we will see later,
eukaryotes arose by symbiotic fusion of prokaryotes. Prokaryotes include
bacteria and a group of cells called archaea, meaning ‘ancient’.

Originally it was thought that there was only one domain of prokaryotes, the
bacteria. One of the great scientific benefits of genome sequencing is that it
becomes possible to compare sequences in many different species. We can then
trace the history of the sequences and derive a phylogenetic tree showing the
most likely way in which each group of organisms is related to the rest. In
1977 Carl Woese used the sequences in ribosomal RNAs to derive the tree shown
in Figure 4.3. Later work using DNA sequencing and chemical characterisation
of the proteins forming the physiological networks in cells has fully
confirmed this interpretation.

![](../Images/17624fig4_3.png)

Figure 4.3

Carl Woese's interpretation of the relationships between the three domains of
life: bacteria, archaea and eukarya. Woese showed that at a molecular level
archaea are more like eukarya than bacteria even though their structure seems
to resemble bacteria more than eukarya, so they are represented as branching
after the division between bacteria and other forms. Note also that animals,
plants and fungi form quite small branches. In terms of biomass, this is a
correct representation of the relative importance. From: Proc. Natl. Acad.
Sci. USA vol. 87, pp. 4576–79, June 1990.

Figure 4.4

Typical structure of a bacterium. There is no nucleus. The DNA is instead
coiled up to form what is called a nucleoid. Various protrusions form
structures that can propel the organism (flagella) and transfer DNA between
bacteria (pili). A bacterium with this kind of shape (there are many other
shapes!) would be about 5–10 µm long and about 1 µm wide

### Bacteria

Bacterial cells have no nucleus. Their DNA simply floats free in the
cytoplasm, usually as a single circular thread. A few have an even simpler
linear thread. It is virtually certain that DNA existed in these or even
simpler forms long before the evolution of the highly complex structures
forming the chromosomes in the nuclei of eukaryotes. The single thread is
usually coiled up to form a kind of nucleus lacking a membrane, called a
nucleoid, but it opens into a looser form when the cell grows large enough to
divide into two. In this open form the DNA is replicated and each daughter
cell receives a copy, which then coils up again. As we will see, this
particular ‘dance of the genes’, already complicated enough, is nevertheless
remarkably simple compared to the elaborately orchestrated events in
eukaryotes.

Bacterial reproduction is therefore by simple fission and is asexual. If this
were all that happens then variation could only happen by mutations in the
cell's own DNA. It may seem therefore that one of the advantages of sexual
reproduction, which is the creation of variants by mixing up two different
genomes, is not available to bacteria. But in fact, some bacteria at least are
highly promiscuous with DNA. They have their own forms of multiple-partner
‘sex’ and they do it all the time, not just when they reproduce. There is a
veritable orgy of DNA sharing amongst organisms at the micro scale, where
individuals acquire new characteristics wherever and whenever they can. Those
characteristics are then inherited.

Does that kind of inheritance sound familiar as a rather heretical idea? The
evidence for and the significance of the inheritance of acquired
characteristics will be dealt with further in [Chapters 5](book-part5.html#CT-
bp-5), [7](book-part7.html#CT-bp-7) and [8](book-part8.html#CT-bp-8).
Meanwhile, let us note that the fraction of life on Earth represented by
bacteria greatly exceeds that of all the plants and animals. They almost
certainly existed for at least one billion years before plants and animals. To
anticipate themes taken up in those later chapters: the standard theory of
evolution presupposes a separate germline isolated from the rest of the
organism, and to which the concept of the Weismann Barrier could apply.3
Before the evolution of a separate germline the theory would not apply. It
could not therefore be relevant to the great majority of the period during
which evolution has happened on Earth. Moreover, the very concept of a species
does not have much sense at the scale of microorganisms.

Bacteria have no fewer than three ways in which they can acquire new DNA
sequences. The first is simply to take in DNA from their environment. The
second is transfer of DNA via viruses called bacteriophages. The third is a
little more like ‘real sex’: transfer of DNA directly from cell to cell by
conjugation. The mechanism by which they incorporate DNA from their
environment, which is called transformation, seems to be an adaptation to
facilitate this process since it depends on a large number of proteins in the
cell, and it also seems to be an adaptation to stressful environments.
Transfer of DNA is one of the ways in which bacterial populations can develop
resistance to antibiotics.4

Conjugation is also a useful adaptation and depends on a remarkable form of
cell-to-cell connection, first discovered in 1946 by the American scientist
Joshua Lederberg and his thesis supervisor Edward Tatum. The cell surfaces of
bacteria have protuberances called flagella that enable the bacterium to move
by using a whip-like motion. Some of these protuberances, called a pilus, can
reach out towards other bacteria to draw them in. The recipient bacterium can
then put out its own pilus, joining with the first to draw the bacteria close
together. DNA can be transferred between them (Figure 4.5).

![](../Images/17624fig4_5.png)

Figure 4.5

Image of the connection between two pili stretching out between the two
bacteria. Each bacterium is about 1 µm across. The bridge is about 6 µm long.
It contracts to draw the two bacteria close together. Exchange of DNA can then
occur (<http://image.slidesharecdn.com/>).

### Archaea

Woese's identification of the archaea as a different domain depends almost
entirely on a molecular approach. At a more superficial cellular structural
level, bacteria and archaea have a lot in common, which is why they were not
originally thought to be from a different lineage in the evolution of life.
But at the molecular level of DNAs, RNAs and proteins there are at least ten
major differences. Moreover, in many of these, including some very important
proteins, archaea actually resemble eukaryotes more than bacteria.5 This is
the reason why the most recent ‘trees of life’ place archaea and eukaryotes on
a common stem separate from bacteria.

They were also initially thought to be found only in extreme environments,
like hot springs and salt lakes. Some live as deep as 3 km underneath the
surface of the Earth at a temperature of 85 °C, where they reduce carbon
dioxide to produce methane. If global warming really becomes a complete run-
away process, they may well be the only organisms left! They have now been
found to occupy most environments on Earth. Vast numbers form part of the tiny
organisms called plankton in the oceans.

Another great contribution to the study of the prokaryotes was also made by
Carl Woese. Archaea share the bacterial propensity for promiscuous sharing of
DNA. Horizontal gene transfer has occurred and still occurs frequently amongst
prokaryotes, and also occurs to some degree amongst eukaryotes. We will look
at the evolutionary significance of this fact in [Chapter 7](book-
part7.html#CT-bp-7).

Woese was actively sidelined by some of the biological scientific
establishment in the twentieth century. The prominent Neo-Darwinist Ernst Mayr
objected strongly in 1998 to his division of the prokaryotes into two domains.
But by 2003 Woese was honoured by receiving the Crafoord Prize, an equivalent
to the Nobel Prize in non-medically oriented biology. The prize was precisely
for the discovery of ‘the third domain’ of life.

The field of evolutionary biology seems to bring out very strong passions in
people – positive and negative. It is almost as though the less illumination
there is on the question of how evolution actually happened, the greater the
heat the debates generate. When it concerns the origins of cellular life, the
one thing we can currently be very certain about is that the answers to most
questions are still very uncertain.

### Eukaryotes: The Largest Organisms but the Smallest Domain

You will have noticed in Figure 4.3 that cells of the kind we have in our
bodies, the eukaryotes, seem to form a relatively small part of the network of
life. Animals and plants form an even smaller part. Is this really a correct
reflection of reality? After all, what we easily see around us are animals,
plants and fungi. It was the study of these that gave rise to the great work
of Lamarck, Darwin, Wallace and others in establishing the now
incontrovertible evidence for the transformation of species. They are also
what you will usually see in zoological and botanical gardens, although some
science museums are increasingly featuring the strange world of prokaryotes.

Appearances are deceptive. In fact, on two major counts, duration and
quantity, the prokaryotes easily dominate life on Earth. They may have done so
alone for one billion years or so from the period of origin of cellular life,
which may have been around 3.5 billion years ago. There are microfossils from
that long ago. The earliest eukaryotic fossils date from 1.7 billion years
ago. Of course, they may have existed earlier without leaving a fossil record
that we have so far been able to find. The prokaryotes also dominate in
quantity. There are vastly more of them than there are of us and our fellow
eukaryotic creatures. It is estimated that the total quantity of carbon locked
up in prokaryotes is similar to the amount locked up in all plants on Earth.

There is another sense, too, in which we, and the whole domain of eukaryotes,
are the smaller domain. We and other animals and plants are made from
prokaryotes, and we are still totally dependent on them. The cells in our
bodies, like all eukaryotic cells, arose from symbiotic association.

The fusion of certain prokaryotic forms to create the immensely complex
organisation of compartmentalised eukaryotic cells was a major step in
evolutionary history. The cellular apparatus in eukaryotes is so rich and
remarkable that their evolution must have occurred in many stages. There must
then have been many stages in the development of multicellular forms of life,
finally leading to the great radiation of such forms in what is called the
Cambrian explosion, around half a billion years ago. Within a few million
years, just a blink of an eye in terms of a history spanning four billion
years, all the main multicellular life forms we see today developed in a
spectacular radiation.6

It is in this context that we can understand another important fact about
eukaryotes and prokaryotes. Eukaryotes have added no new metabolic energy
transforming proteins. Both respiration and photosynthesis are carried out by
mitochondria and plastids respectively, which of course came from
symbiogenesis involving prokaryotes. Many of the basic functional processes of
life originated in prokaryotes.

We can best appreciate just how great the difference in organisation is by
comparing the cell cycles in prokaryotes and eukaryotes (Figure 4.6).

![](../Images/17624fig4_6.png)

Figure 4.6

Diagram of the stages of nuclear mitosis
([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/About/primer/genetics_cell.html](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/About/primer/genetics_cell.html)).

### The Cell Cycle

The way in which cells without nuclei – the prokaryotes – divide and reproduce
is clearly not possible when the DNA is locked up inside the nucleus. The
nucleus is rather like a cell itself – a cell within a cell – and this is
almost certainly how it came into being. A fusion of cells into symbiotic
union must have created the first eukaryotes from prokaryotes. You might
expect therefore that when a eukaryote divides there must be several stages
since the cell within the cell also has to divide. The precise details vary,
but the sequence is: reproduction of DNA within the nucleus, division of the
chromosomes, division or dissolution of the nuclear membrane, separation of
the two sets of chromosomes and finally division of the complete cell.

The first two stages leading to two separate nuclei is the process we call
mitosis. The last stage is called cytokinesis. The complete process has to be
seen to be believed. A whole army of protein networks are employed by the cell
to orchestrate a grand dance of the chromosomes, worthy of a Tchaikovskian
ballet. Or, given the overtly sexual connotations, perhaps Stravinsky's Rite
of Spring (Figure 4.7)?

![](../Images/17624fig4_7.png)

Figure 4.7

Organisation of a typical mitotic spindle found in animal cells. Chromosomes
are attached to kinetochore microtubules via a multiprotein complex called the
kinetochore. Polar microtubules interdigitate at the spindle midzone and push
the spindle poles apart via motor proteins. Astral microtubules anchor the
spindle poles to the cell membrane. Microtubule polymerisation is nucleated at
the microtubule organising centre (Lordjuppiter (own work)

(source: <http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Spindle_apparatus.svg> (CC
BY-SA 3.0 (<http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0>)))).

First, each of the chromosome's DNA threads are replicated. A set of proteins
carries out this process and checks for the accuracy of copying, repairing
mistakes as required. This process is carried out while the DNA is available
to be read. Once the real dance begins, the DNA threads can no longer be
copied since they then coil tightly around the histone proteins to form the
now visible chromosomes. Those appear as double chromosomes, hitched together
at the middle of each pair by yet another protein complex. The next stage is
the most remarkable. Each of the chromosome pairs gets attached to filaments
that form as a spindle, each half ready to pull the separated chromosomes to
opposite ends. The nuclear membrane then divides or, in those cells where the
membrane dissolves, the membrane reforms, so that two equivalent nuclei now
exist. The cell itself then divides and in the process a nucleus and a share
of all the organelles, membranes, microfilaments and free chemicals is
allocated to each daughter cell.

The process is clearly theatrically dramatic. The chromosomes are literally
like puppets on strings, dancing to the tune of the cell. It takes about an
hour, which is short compared to the length of time between mitotic periods.
What sets it all in motion? Is there a nuclear ‘clock’ dictating the timing?
No, the trigger is a cytoplasmic protein, one of a set of proteins controlling
the cell cycle and therefore called cyclins (Figure 4.8).

![](../Images/17624fig4_8.png)

Figure 4.8

before the chromosomes (red) are separated and pulled to each end of the cell
(Roy van Heesbeen, via Wikimedia Commons).

It is important to note that in this complex sequence of events, DNA does not
directly do anything other than be copied and separated by the sets of
proteins that perform these tasks. It does not directly command the process.
It is the cell networks that choreograph the ballet. The DNA is a passive
participant.

This is also the direction of causality when DNA is being used as a template
for making proteins during the long periods between mitosis and cell division.
The signals for DNA to be transcribed come from the rest of the cell. During
the normal ‘resting’ phases, the transcription of DNA to form RNAs and
proteins is signalled by proteins called transcription factors that attach to
regulatory sites on DNA. The levels of the RNAs and proteins formed are also
dependent on the degree of methylation of DNA, and on binding of regulatory
molecules to the chromatin proteins. There is continuous interaction between
the cell physiology and DNA transcription in order to maintain cell function.
DNA itself does not interact directly with the protein-forming machinery. It
is RNA that performs that role. Only when DNA has been transcribed into RNA
does that machinery get activated.

What triggers mitosis? Once again, the answer lies in the cell networks and
the proteins forming them. The final signal for the transition to begin
mitosis is a protein forming part of a family appropriately called cyclins. It
was the identification of this cyclin and a cyclin-dependent kinase that was
celebrated with the Nobel Prize awarded in 2001 to the British biologists Paul
Nurse and Timothy Hunt and the American Leland Hartwell. The genes that form
the templates for these proteins are often referred to as the genes that
‘control’ the cell cycle. In particular, the gene called cdc2 (cell division
cycle gene 2 – part of a family of around 100 such genes) was identified by
Paul Nurse as the ‘start’ gene in a particular strain of yeast cells. The
discovery was of great importance both for the fundamental nature of cell
biology and for research on diseases like cancer, where cells proliferate ‘out
of control’ and invade the rest of the body.7

But readers of this book will already suspect that I don't go along with the
concept of causality often used in science popularisation to describe what is
happening here. A single stretch of DNA cannot ‘know’ when to trigger mitosis.
No single gene, or even a set of genes, can possibly have this kind of natural
dynamic purposiveness. That purposive behaviour lies in the networks, since
they have the dynamics necessary for the logical operations required to work
out when the cell state is ready for division and what to do to ensure that,
usually, this takes place accurately. This is natural purposiveness and we
will encounter more examples in later chapters. Such purposiveness necessarily
emerges at a level that has the degree of dynamic complexity necessary for it
to be instantiated. Cells clearly have that complexity. Molecules do not. It
goes without saying that this is not conscious purposiveness. It is
purposiveness in the sense that the organism responds to challenges in a
logical way. We don't need to know how the logical purposiveness developed in
order to recognise it in the behaviour of an organism.

### Meiosis

The intelligence to choreograph mitosis is remarkable enough. The story gets
even better when we consider what happens in the germ cells of organisms that
use sexual reproduction.

The functional significance of sex is still a hot topic of debate in biology.
As we saw earlier in this chapter, exchanging DNA in prokaryotes could be an
effective way for populations to adapt by discovering new combinations of DNA
sequences, and this has been a major factor in the evolution of bacteria and
archaea. As we will see in [Chapter 7](book-part7.html#CT-bp-7), acquiring DNA
from other organisms is not absent in eukaryotes but it is thought to be far
less frequent. The main process by which mixing of genomes can occur is
through sexual reproduction when genome reorganisation and recombinations can
occur at two different stages. The first precedes DNA replication. Before the
cell divides, exchange of DNA occurs between each of a pair of chromosomes,
each of which originally came from one of the two parents. The cell then
divides yet again, but there is an important difference. The second division
is not preceded by a further replication. Instead, each daughter cell, now
called a germ cell or gamete, receives only one of each kind of chromosome.
The cell is said to be haploid, instead of diploid (Figure 4.9).

![](../Images/17624fig4_9.png)

Figure 4.9

Diagram showing the stages during meiosis. This is the equivalent diagram to
that for mitosis shown in Figure 4.6 (National Institutes of Health, public
domain).

This enables a further round of mixing when the germ cells of two different
organisms fuse through the process of fertilisation to restore the double
chromosome number.

Once again, all of this is orchestrated by networks incorporating cyclin and
related proteins.

### RNA and Other Early Worlds?

As we have seen, the genome and the systems that have evolved for managing it
are extraordinarily complex. How could it have evolved and what did it evolve
from? These are difficult questions to which there are no secure answers as
yet. We might have hoped that comparison of DNA sequences would give us some
clues, as indeed it has about the later stages of evolution. But massive
lateral exchange of DNA during the early cellular stages when prokaryotes were
the only cell forms in existence would have blurred any evidence of very
ancient lineages. This is the main reason why all the modern diagrams of
trees, networks and circles of life, relating living organisms to each other,
fade into uncertainty at the bottom.

But we can be sure that a system as complex as the genome could not have
existed in the early stages. DNA alone is not alive. It depends on living
systems to perform its functions. This is one of the reasons for thinking that
the evolution of RNA and its interactions must have preceded that of DNA. On
this view there was an RNA world earlier in evolution. This view also fits
with the fact that DNA is not used directly to manufacture proteins; RNAs
perform that function.

Conceivably, such worlds may exist elsewhere in the universe, which is an
exciting possibility for extra-terrestrial biology. Another fact favouring
this interpretation is that RNAs can also act as enzymes, which are necessary
to speed up biochemical reactions. Functioning biological networks using
organic enzymes could therefore have existed before the evolution of DNA and
complex proteins. And before RNA it is likely that inorganic catalysts played
that role. The really ancient roots of metabolic networks may lie in hot,
rocky crevices containing the essential trace elements ([Figure 2.2](book-
part2.html#FIG-fig-7)), acting as natural facilitators of the speed of
reactions. Those elements are essential because even today they are necessary
as part of the active sites in many protein catalysts. Perhaps those trace
elements are a kind of ‘living fossil’ evidence of the geochemical origin of
life. The fact that they are only found in combination with proteins (not
nucleotides) suggests that peptides evolved before nucleotides in an early
metabolism-led phase of evolution.

What, then, could have formed the membrane channels necessary to control the
internal environment? Today, those are all formed by complex proteins, but the
highly developed forms of proteins that enable such elaborate channels to
occur are very unlikely to have existed before the development of RNA and DNA.
The answer is that there are simpler peptide molecules that can form pores in
lipid membranes. Some of these, such as valinomycin,8 can form pores that are
highly selective. There is evidence that a limited number of peptide- and
protein-forming amino acids may have existed four billion years ago.9

The problem remains, what could have served the container function before the
evolution of membranes? A suggestion made by Michael Russell working at NASA's
Jet Propulsion Laboratory is consistent with the geo-thermal view of the
origin of life. This is that iron sulphide could have served the role. The
elements iron (Fe) and sulphur (S) are amongst the important trace elements in
organisms ([Figure 2.2](book-part2.html#FIG-fig-7)). This is in the ‘way out’
category of hypothesis, but it is in the very nature of work on the origin of
cells that we have to address the question of what could have come before
them. At present, that must be sheer speculation. ‘Way out’ ideas are all we
have.10

### How Cells Form Tissues

Multicellular organisms form tissues, organs and whole systems, as we saw in
[Chapter 2](book-part2.html#CT-bp-2). Do the cells just congregate, rather as
the amoebas do when they form a slime mould? The answer to that question is
that more permanent connections have evolved. A family of proteins,
appropriately called connexins, form channels that can span across the bilayer
membranes of two cells. Those channels allow many molecules to pass that
become, as it were, of common ownership within the tissue. They also
contribute to its structural stability, although this is also ensured by
specialist cells forming what is called connective tissue.

### The Nearly Cells: Viruses

Viruses are the tiniest particles of ‘living’ material, so small that an
electron microscope is necessary to visualise them. Most consist of little
more than some DNA or RNA enclosed or wrapped around a protein structure. They
are not living organisms by the usual definitions. They require a host cell to
use its special protein machinery to replicate its DNA. Their evolutionary
origin is unclear. They can't be the original living organisms since they
require other organisms to survive and be copied. They are clear evidence, if
any more were now needed, that DNA alone is dead, inactive.

Although their origins are unclear, their role in evolution may have been very
important since they can be a source of lateral transfer of DNA and RNA.

### Tree, Networks or Rings of Life?

The idea that species transform into new species, championed by Lamarck, was
already a basis for supposing that there must be lineages, perhaps going back
to common ancestral forms. Darwin formalised this in his famous tree of life
sketch (see [Figure 5.1](book-part5.html#FIG-fig-31)). Modern developments of
that sketch now abound. Some continue to represent it as a simple tree: a
single trunk with branches but no interconnections between them. That is
clearly no longer tenable. We have to recognise that for the great majority of
life lateral gene transfer made the tree into a network at its roots at least,
but probably elsewhere too. Symbiogenesis to create organelles like
mitochondria and chloroplasts make parts of it look like a ring since formerly
separate branches reconnected.

For this book I searched for a modern diagram that represents all these new
and very significant findings. I found Figure 4.10 in a lovely book, In Search
of Cell History, by the American cell biochemist Franklin Harold.12 Viruses
and the earliest cells are represented as having arisen from the Earth's early
geochemistry. We know very little indeed about what may have happened during
that early period, nor when exactly it happened. It is quite possible that it
happened several times before the evolution of organisms really took off. We
do not know how the earliest cells and viruses were related. Viruses might
have been protocells that regressed and lost their independent ability to
reproduce. A purely virus world would be impossible since viruses depend on
using a cell's machinery to reproduce.

Figure 4.10

A tentative ‘tree of life’ proposed by Franklin Harold. Viruses and the
earliest cells are represented as having arisen from the Earth's early
geochemistry. The diagram includes the lateral transfers that create networks
of inheritance of DNA, and the ‘rings’ arising from incorporation of
proteobacteria and cyanobacteria into eukaryotes. LUCA is the postulated last
universal common ancestor, but it should be understood that this may have been
a pool of such ancestors. The concept of separate organisms would have been
inappropriate for a period before well-defined cell enclosure by membranes
occurred. LECA is the last eukaryotic common ancestor (from Harold 2014).11

It is then thought that there was a common ancestor (LUCA: last universal
common ancestor) before the division into bacteria and archaea. Eukaryotes
then branched off from archaea to form the LECA (last eukaryotic common
ancestor) from which plants, animals and fungi then branched off. There are
two important features of this illustration that should be emphasised. First,
there was extensive exchange of DNA material during the early period of
evolution. This continues, though thought to be at a less frequent rate, in
the later stages.13 Second, the great majority of the evolutionary process
occurred before the emergence of animals, plants and fungi. Unicellular
organisms are by far the most abundant ones on Earth even today.

### The Death of Cells

An important process in multicellular organisms is cell death, or in technical
language, apoptosis. This is also a kind of dance initiated by the environment
in which the cell exists. The tissues and organs of the body ‘know’ when some
cells are not needed or even when they become dangerous. An example of not
being needed would be the cells that exist between what are to become the
digits of a limb. The developmental process eliminates them to enable the
separate fingers or toes to form. An example of being dangerous would be
cancerous cells. Apoptosis is often called ‘programmed cell death’. That
terminology is okay provided we don't draw the conclusion that there is a cell
death programme in our DNA.

You might think that a DNA programme for death, including cell death, must
surely exist. Aren't we programmed to die before a certain age to leave room
for the young? Well, no, not really. Consider this. Longevity is an extremely
rare phenomenon in nature. Wild species generally live much shorter lives
compared to what is possible in a sheltered environment. Modern biological
studies of the ageing process have shown that the heredity component in ageing
is only around 25%, and attempts to find a genetic programme for death have
failed despite many attempts in organisms like nematode worms.

### Conclusions

This chapter concludes the trio of [chapters (2](book-part2.html#CT-bp-2)–4)
introducing but also radically re-interpreting some of the main features of
biology to prepare the reader for the following chapters, where the
consequences of a relativistic interpretation of biology will be developed.
Many hints have already been given in these early chapters of what is to come.
There will therefore be strong echoes of those hints as you read on. As noted
in the Preface, there will be a little repetition in some of the chapters,
albeit always from a different angle. Novel and perhaps unexpected re-
interpretations are best taken in by stages. I have also tried to make each
chapter self-contained so that readers who prefer dipping in rather than
cover-to-cover reading can quickly get the message of the book.

We are now ready to tackle the big questions of evolutionary biology and of
Biological Relativity. [Chapter 5](book-part5.html#CT-bp-5) will introduce the
orthodox Neo-Darwinist view of evolutionary biology. [Chapter 6](book-
part6.html#CT-bp-6) will introduce the principles of Biological Relativity.
[Chapters 7](book-part7.html#CT-bp-7) and [8](book-part8.html#CT-bp-8) will
then discuss what needs to replace Neo-Darwinism as an exclusive theory of
evolution. The principle of relativity requires an inclusive theory.

4 Precisely this process has now been shown to face the world with a potential
health disaster. Scientists in China have shown that horizontal DNA transfer
between bacteria has allowed antibiotic resistance to develop in a way that
could be the beginning of what some have called the antibiotic apocalypse, a
post-antibiotic era plunging the world back into the ‘dark ages’ of medicine
before antibiotics were discovered. Bacteria with the transferred MCR-1 DNA
sequence (gene) were found in both pigs and humans. Liu, Y.Y., Y. Wang, T.R.

13 It was originally thought that such transfer would be impossible in
multicellular organisms. But it is important to remember that all
multicellular organisms using sexual reproduction go through a unicellular
phase, the unicellular egg and sperm. Sperm have been shown to acquire DNA
from their environment and transfer this DNA to the offspring. Pittoggi, C.,

that an efficient machinery is present in mature spermatozoa, which can
transcribe, splice, and reverse-transcribe exogenous DNA molecules. This
mechanism is implicated in the genesis and non-Mendelian propagation of new
genetic information besides that contained in chromosomes.’



## 5 Blind Chance and Natural Selection

When these deviations only affect the soma, they give rise to temporary non-
hereditary variations; but when they occur in the germ-plasm, they are
transmitted to the next generation and cause corresponding hereditary
variations in the body.

(August Weismann, 1892, author of germ-plasm theory, Keimplasma: Eine Theorie
der Vererbung)

### Charles Darwin and his Predecessors

Charles Darwin published his ground-breaking work The Origin of Species in
1859. The book was finished in a hurry, but the ideas that he developed into
his theory of evolution by natural selection had slowly matured through three
decades since his famous voyage on The Beagle in 1831–1836 (Figure 5.1).1

![](../Images/17624fig5_1.png)

Figure 5.1

Adaptive radiation in the finches of the Galapagos islands, with Darwin's
diagram of radiation beginning ‘I think…’. He observed similar radiation in
the tortoises on the different islands ([www.biomedware.com/blog/2012/genetic-
gis-a-call-and-a-research-
agenda/](http://www.biomedware.com/blog/2012/genetic-gis-a-call-and-a-
research-agenda/), right: Charles Darwin's 1837 sketch of an evolutionary tree
from his First Notebook on Transmutation of Species (1837)).

In South America and its offshore islands, particularly the Galapagos Islands
straddling the equator in the Pacific Ocean, he saw the astonishing variety of
living organisms and how they differed from what he knew in Europe. They
differed even between the different islands. The birds and reptiles on the
separate islands were particularly convincing. They differed in ways that
strongly suggested a common origin followed by adaptation and drift in the
environment of each island. The beaks of birds, for example, changed according
to the kind of food available. The finches were clearly well-adapted to the
particular environment of each island. So were the reptiles. He knew also that
plasticity of a similar kind, showing variations in the detail within a common
overall form, had been exploited by animal and plant breeders for thousands of
years. By selecting varieties that emphasised some features like size, colour,
facial shapes, slenderness or strength, and many others, they had produced by
artificial selection an astonishing variety of dogs, cats, cattle, horses,
fish and plants. His insight, developed back in England after the voyage of
The Beagle, was that selection could have created similar variation naturally
without human intervention. And so the idea of natural selection was born. All
it needed was already existing variations on which the environment could act
to make some forms more successful than others. He became convinced that
different species must have evolved in this way from earlier forms, stretching
back to a possible common ancestor.

However, he did not know what may have caused the variations on which natural
selection could act. He did not know that Gregor Mendel was already performing
his experiments on plant hybridisation and the laws of transmission of
inherited characteristics (traits), which were published in 1866, but not
widely known until after Darwin's lifetime. In this respect, Darwin's book was
not so much about the origin of species as about their selection.
Nevertheless, the ideas of natural selection, and the evidence from his
journeys and observations, were powerful enough for him to produce his great
masterpiece.

The book was finally published in a hurry when another naturalist, Alfred
Russel Wallace, was hot on his heels with similar ideas.2 Wallace was a
leading figure in the study of the geographical dispersion of animal species
and he had made similar discoveries of great variation in the Malay
Archipelago on the other side of the world. This vast group of islands is also
tropical. Moreover, it consists of two groups of islands separated by what
became called the Wallace line. One group must have been populated by animals
from the Australian region, the other by South-East Asian ones, leading to
very different origins of the species. This striking fact and the other
differences between the islands led Wallace also to the conclusion that
natural selection could be the explanation. Justice was served by the Linnean
Society of London, where an 1858 paper of Wallace was presented at the same
time as an unpublished paper of Charles Darwin that he had written in 1844.3
That paper is the reason why Darwin was judged to have priority in developing
the idea, and Wallace graciously accepted the outcome.4

As often happens when a work of many years is completed in a hurry, Darwin had
cause to regret the final rush. In particular, he had not had time to write a
proper acknowledgement of previous work, even though he knew that such
existed. His predecessors even included his grandfather, Erasmus Darwin. So
Charles Darwin knew that he was by no means the first to propose a theory of
the transformation of species, as evolution was called in his time. Darwin
corrected this omission in the third edition of the Origin, where he
acknowledged no fewer than 30 predecessors. He was generous in his selection.
Even Aristotle was listed. In the fourth edition the list had grown to 38.5
Prominent in this list was Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, of whom Darwin wrote ‘this
justly celebrated naturalist…who upholds the doctrine that all species,
including man, are descended from other species’.

He had good reason to praise Lamarck. Half a century earlier in his
Philosophie Zoologique, published in 1809, exactly 50 years before Darwin's
Origin, Lamarck had laid out the reasons for transformationism, which he had
to defend against severe critics amongst his scientific colleagues, just as
Darwin would have to do. Darwin was greatly helped in this task by Thomas
Henry Huxley, ‘Darwin's bulldog’, who acted as the public face of Darwinism,
while Darwin himself worked quietly away at his country home. Lamarck had to
fight his battles in the intellectually challenging Parisian culture, largely
alone against powerful opponents like Georges Cuvier, who wrote an obituary
oration that systematically trashed Lamarck's reputation. That oration was
read at Lamarck's pauper burial and it was to reverberate like a death knell
across time, as we will see in [Chapter 6](book-part6.html#CT-bp-6). It was
written from a highly biased perspective. Cuvier believed in a form of
creationism which proposed that new species were separately created following
global catastrophes, and he was strongly opposed to Lamarck's ideas.

### Darwin on Lamarckism

But the championing of transformationism was not the only reason Darwin had
for praising Lamarck. Lamarck is also known for having embraced the idea of
the inheritance of acquired characteristics and developed it into a theory of
transformation of species. Amongst those who accepted transformationism, this
was a common view. Use and disuse of organs of the body were thought to be the
cause of inherited changes. Fish living in unlit caves had become blind
through not using their eyes, giraffes had grown long necks through reaching
up to higher trees for food. This idea became known as Lamarckism because it
was the mechanism of variation assumed, but not invented, by Lamarck. I think
Lamarck would be surprised to find it called Lamarckism, but we are now stuck
with that word so I will use it freely in this book.6

Many people today believe that Darwin was opposed to Lamarck's idea. That is
not correct. On the contrary, there are 12 places in the Origin where this
process is referred to. In fact, he went even further than Lamarck. He
proposed a biological mechanism for how it may happen. This is not difficult
to envisage in unicellular organisms, where the cell that forms the whole
organism divides to reproduce. Changes in the structure of the cell can
therefore be inherited even if the genetic ma-terial is not changed. The first
experimental example of this process was discovered by Tracy Sonneborn,
working in the USA in the 1960s, who showed that changing the orientation of
the swimming cilia in a part of the animal by surgery produced an inherited
characteristic, transmitted down at least two subsequent generations.

This kind of inheritance is also easier to imagine in plants, many of which
can reproduce from any part of the plant. Indeed, I think that such
inheritance must occur in such organisms.7 To exclude the inheritance of
acquired characteristics a priori must be misguided since much more is
inherited than the genetic database that we now know is DNA.

That is necessarily true for all single-cell organisms. They form the vast
majority of life on Earth. Remember, too, that for most of the period of
evolution those were the only organisms that existed. Before the evolution of
multicellular organisms with a separate germ line of cells distinct from the
somatic cells, there wasn't a problem. It is a little-appreciated fact that
the Modern Synthesis which will be analysed later in this chapter could only
ever have been properly applied to a relatively small period of the
evolutionary process, perhaps no more than 20%.

The problem that Darwin saw is that it is not obvious how such a process could
happen in multicellular organisms possessing a separate germ line. If changes
in the soma occur as a consequence of adaptation to the environment, there is
no reason why this should change the germ line cells unless the adaptation is
somehow transmitted to them. How, for example, could an adaptation in a sense
organ like the eye, forming part of the soma, have an effect on sperm or egg
cells far away in the reproductive organs containing the germ cells? Something
would have to transmit the information to the germ cells so that it could be
inherited by the next generation. To deal with this problem Darwin invented
the idea of gemmules, little particles that he supposed to travel through the
blood to carry the relevant influences.8 As we will see in [Chapter 8](book-
part8.html#CT-bp-8), this idea is not very far away from the evidence on what
we know today about possible mechanisms for this form of inheritance.9

Perhaps one reason why Darwin continued to include a Lamarckian process was
that, deep down, he must have been unhappy that he did not know the mechanism
of variation and that selection alone could not provide that. Darwin was a
worrier, never fully happy with his Ideas.10

For these reasons, amongst others, Darwin's view of evolution was a fairly
nuanced one with multiple mechanisms, prominent amongst which was natural
selection. One reason for that caution is that people at that time knew
nothing about genetics. He wrote in the first edition of the Origin: ‘I am
convinced that natural selection has been the main, but not the exclusive
means of modification’,11 a statement he reiterated with increased force in
the sixth edition in 1872. The caution in avoiding the claim that natural
selection was the only process involved is characteristic of Darwin, who often
expressed his own doubts and uncertainties. Sadly, this cautious humility has
not been shared by many who claim to follow in his footsteps. It is an
important part of the reasons for which Darwin was not a Neo-Darwinist.

### The Rise of Neo-Darwinism Leading to the Modern Synthesis

As we will see in this chapter, Neo-Darwinism is significantly different from
Darwin's more nuanced position and therefore needs to be clearly distinguished
from Darwinism. Many Neo-Darwinists today fail to acknowledge this and readily
imply that they are Darwinists. Neo-Darwinism was first introduced as a term
by the physiologist George Romanes in a letter to Nature in 1895,12 but the
roots go back to August Weismann in around 1870. Neo-Darwinism led to a
narrowing down of the mechanisms supposed to have been involved in the origin
of different species. The motivation for the development of Neo-Darwinism was
a move to exclude Lamarckism. Despite Darwin's acceptance of the idea, the
inheritance of acquired characteristics was deemed impossible. Natural
selection working on chance variations in genetic ma-terial was thought to be
entirely sufficient to explain all evolutionary change.

To explain how this narrow interpretation of Darwin's ideas came about, we
need to turn to early experiments to test Lamarckism.

As we have seen, Darwin's work was done with no knowledge of genetics.
Mendel's work on the genetics of hybridisation in peas was not rediscovered
until the late nineteenth century, when the first experiments to test the
inheritance of acquired characteristics were also done.

August Weismann was the first to do this in 1890. He decided to do so not by
exposing animals, and particularly their embryos, to different environments,
but rather by treating them surgically. This fact is crucial. The experiments
consisted in amputating the tails of mice and then observing whether this had
any effect on the progeny. The answer was a clear ‘no’. Since this work forms
a foundation stone of Neo-Darwinism, it is important to ask whether it really
answers the relevant question. We can then return to the development of Neo-
Darwinism.

Even on the older versions of Lamarckism, as expressed by Lamarck himself,
this is a curiously inappropriate way of testing the idea. The idea is that
Lamarckian inheritance may occur in a functional interaction between the
organisms and their environment, through use and disuse of the organism's
structures and functions, not whether the non-functional results of surgery
can be inherited. Darwin must have known already from the work of animal
breeders that such inheritance did not occur. Tail amputation in dogs for
aesthetic reasons does not result in stunted tails in the offspring, no matter
how many generations are bred from the animals. To put the question in a more
modern form, it is whether the germ line is or is not isolated from
environmental influences. The relevant way to do a tail-cutting experiment or
any other experiment to answer that question would be to change the
environment in a way that makes tail-lessness a functional advantage. Quite
apart from the obvious question of why a surgical change should be inherited,
even a standard Lamarckian would notice that the environment, apart from the
surgery, is not different. Furthermore, even if there were environments that
would favour tail-lessness, the experiment would not test for that. The work
of Conrad Waddington in [Chapter 8](book-part8.html#CT-bp-8) will show the
more successful way forward for such experiments.

Nevertheless, the experiment convinced Weismann and others that Lamarckism is
impossible. The Weismann Barrier, i.e. the isolation of the germ cells from
the soma, then became a cornerstone of the development of Neo-Darwinism into
the Modern Synthesis.

At its roots, therefore, Neo-Darwinism, in relying on the Weismann Barrier so
completely as a kind of dogma, made a serious mistake that could have been
avoided.13 As we will see, as Neo-Darwinism developed into the Modern
Synthesis, it also made a further mistake in embracing the molecular
biological equivalent of the Weismann Barrier, which is the Central Dogma of
Molecular Biology.14 Unnecessary dogmatism has unfortunately haunted
evolutionary biology.15

Weismann is also credited with the idea, which he developed in his Essays upon
Heredity as early as 1889, that changes in the germ line cells were largely
random, which also became a kind of dogma. He was therefore responsible for
the two main assumptions of the Modern Synthesis and it is not surprising that
he is often judged to be the most important evolutionary biology thinker
forming the link between Darwin and the formulation of the Modern Synthesis in
the 1930s and 1940s. Ernst Mayr, author of the magisterial 1982 book The
Growth of Biological Thought, described him as ‘one of the great biologists of
all time’.

It is curious, to say the least, that such a distinguished and widely praised
scientist should have put up such an inappropriate straw man to knock down,
and even more curious that so many other eminent scientists should have
accepted it as the basis of a major evolutionary theory. No major publishable
science today could be based on such flimsy and inappropriate evidence.16 Why
did Weismann and his successors do that?

In Weismann's case, part of the answer lies in the little-known fact that he
fully acknowledged that his experiments disproved only the inheritance of
surgical mutilation.17 He performed these experiments because he was aware of
‘Lamarckian’ claims that such mutilations could be inherited. The straw man
had already been set up by over-imaginative Lamarckians, who had claimed, for
example, that repeated circumcision in the generations of populations that
practise this particular surgery could lead to babies born without foreskins.
He well knew the limitations of his experiments and that their crudeness was
responding to a similarly crude alternative. I suspect, therefore, that he
must have had other reasons for being so sure of the barrier idea. He may
already have been convinced of the correctness of his other assumption, the
randomness of variations. And he delivered an important lecture in 1883 (‘On
inheritance’) in which he rejected the inheritance of acquired characteristics
and proposed alternative explanations for the use and disuse examples Darwin
gave in the Origin. But that still leaves the question of why so many other
leading scientists followed in his footsteps and enshrined the Weismann
Barrier into the Modern Synthesis. The mistake is not a subtle one.
Mutilations simply do not test a functional interaction between an organism
and the environment. Nor does showing that there are alternative explanations
for Darwin's examples prove that they are the correct explanations. So far as
I am aware, the tail-cutting experiments he performed are the only direct
experimental tests.

The answer to that puzzle lies in the names of two great scientists: Gregor
Mendel, the originator of modern genetics, and Erwin Schrödinger, the great
quantum mechanics pioneer.

### Evolution and Genetics

Darwin's work was done with no knowledge of genetics, nor of the remarkable
quantitative results being obtained in a European monastery in what today is
the Czech Republic, even as the Origin was published. Weismann's early
experiments were also performed without knowing of Gregor Mendel's work. But
soon after that was rediscovered in 1900 many noticed that it married well
with Weismann's ideas and those of the developing concept of Neo-Darwinism.

Mendel was interested in the hybridisation of pea plants in the monastery
garden. He crossed plants with different characteristics in the peas, pods and
flowers. He noticed two facts that have become standard in the teaching of
genetics. The first is that, often, characteristics are inherited in an all-
or-nothing manner. Peas were either smooth or wrinkled, not usually something
between. Other characteristics also showed this behaviour. Yet, a plant
showing one characteristic could still give rise to plants with the other
characteristic, even if crossed with a plant with the same characteristic. He
came to the conclusion that there must be hidden genetic elements and that
some were dominant and some recessive. In a plant with genes for both, only
the dominant characteristic would be expressed. This is a common feature of
inheritance in many species. Two humans with the same hair colour, say black,
can have progeny with ginger hair. The dominant–recessive idea can easily
explain this kind of result. Both parents must have had recessive ginger
genes. Since sexual reproduction transmits two copies of the genetic material
to the progeny, the recessive characteristic will only be manifest if both
contain the gene for this characteristic. There is no blending. The same was
thought to be true of eye colour in mammals. In humans, we find either blue or
brown, not brownish blue or bluish brown.18

This discovery was the basis of the development of an atomistic view of
genetics. Genes can act seemingly as single ‘atomic’ elements to produce the
phenotype characteristic, and they do so in an all-or-nothing manner. This
leaves no room for Lamarckian blending. Although Weismann was initially
sceptical of Mendel's work, his followers readily saw it as providing the
necessary boost to otherwise flimsy evidence for the impossibility of
Lamarckian inheritance. This partly explains the reason why the flimsy
surgical evidence was deemed sufficient, though not on its own.

The next step in Mendel's work laid the foundations for quantitative genetics,
and for all the wonderful advances that were to come during and following the
formulation of the Modern Synthesis in what became called population genetics.
Evolutionary biology could at last become mathematical.

The idea is simple to explain. Mendel saw that if it required parents with
both dominant and recessive copies of the gene involved, and if the
inheritance is all-or-nothing, then it is easy to predict the ratio in which
the progeny should show the recessive character. Let's call the forms D and R.
Today we call these alleles. They occupy the same position in the genome and
substitute for each other in the sequence. Mendel could not have known that,
of course, but he nevertheless saw that the process was ‘atomistic’ and
‘quantal’ in expression. If the D and R forms in parents that have both are
mixed randomly during sexual reproduction, then the chances of the following
forms in the offspring would all be equally likely to occur: DD, DR, RD and
RR. But only RR would allow R to be expressed. So, it would appear just 25% of
the time. Mendel's second great discovery was that this is what happens.19

To some modern eyes, steeped in the maths of this kind of probability
calculation and in the uncertainties that must be present in any experimental
science using probabilities, Mendel's results have seemed just a little bit
too good to be entirely true. Perhaps he had reasons for excluding some data.
All science does that to some extent. There are nearly always rogue results.
The difficulty lies in establishing really sound criteria for excluding any
data. Nevertheless, no one doubts that Mendel's insight, and the broad sweep
of his results, were correct.20

Notice also the assumption of randomness here. If genetic mixing in sexual
reproduction is a random process, then perhaps all variations are random. It
is easy to see why Mendel's work bolstered Weismann's ideas. And so, the
incorporation of Mendelian mathematics into Neo-Darwinism led to the full
formulation of the Modern Synthesis during the first half of the twentieth
century, leading up to the publication of Julian Huxley's book, The Modern
Synthesis, in 1942.

### The Modern Synthesis

Mendel's genetic experiments were unknown when the term Neo-Darwinism was
coined at the end of the nineteenth century. One of the reasons why Neo-
Darwinism developed into what is called the Modern Synthesis is the
integration of Mendelian genetics into the Neo-Darwinist framework.

Many biological scientists today who claim to adhere to the Modern Synthesis
and therefore describe themselves as Neo-Darwinists actually accept some or
even all of the exceptions and breaks with Neo-Darwinism that I will describe
in [Chapters 7](book-part7.html#CT-bp-7) and [8](book-part8.html#CT-bp-8).
Neo-Darwinism (recall that I am using the terms interchangeably because that
is what many Neo-Darwinists do today) was such a successful theory in terms of
the areas of science that it spawned, and it chimed so well with what were
thought to be secure discoveries in molecular biology, that it is
understandable that many people would prefer to take the view that it can
readily accommodate exceptions and new mechanisms. With a little bit of
underplaying on how important the exceptions might be, and how they might be
the exceptions that ‘prove the rule’, this is a tactic often adopted during
paradigmatic shifts in understanding.21

This book argues that it is not sufficient to accommodate the exceptions as
minor in this way. To make it clear why I take that view it is helpful to
summarise what I see as the original central ideas of Neo-Darwinism before
analysing the philosophical ideas that underpin it. They correspond very well
indeed with the major popularisations of the theory, including Richard
Dawkins’ 1976 book The Selfish Gene, which has not only popularised the
theory, but also spawned many applications, implications and consequences in
fields as diverse as philosophy, economics, theology, sociology, politics and
literature, as well as within the standard biological and physical sciences.
It is hard to think of a scientific popularisation that has had as wide and
deep an impact as this, which is a tribute to the highly successful style in
which Dawkins writes his many books.

##### The Original Version

The main ideas in the original formulation of Neo-Darwinism are:

1. All changes in the genetic material are random, as Weismann first proposed. It is important to note that what is meant is that genetic change is random with respect to function. This is the ‘blind chance’ part of the theory with no room for teleology.

2. The germ line cells are completely isolated from the rest of the organism. Dawkins encapsulated this view in The Selfish Gene: ‘Sealed off from the outside world.’

3. Development is simply an unfolding of what is in the DNA ‘blueprint’. The great twentieth-century expounder of Neo-Darwinism Ernst Mayr put it very succinctly in 1982: ‘All of the directions, controls and constraints of the developmental machinery are laid down in the blueprint of the DNA genotype as instructions or potentialities.’

4. The random variations may produce organisms that are less or more fit in the environment they find themselves in.

5. The more fit organisms produce more offspring that are fertile than the less fit ones.

6. This will therefore lead to the genes in the fitter individuals gradually coming to dominate the gene pool of the population. This is natural selection, Darwin's central idea.

There are also some negative statements to add to the list. Most important is
the exclusion of Lamarckian forms of inheritance. Some modern defenders of
Neo-Darwinism claim to accommodate the Lamarckian forms that have now been
discovered, but this seems to me to be contrary to common sense.22 The central
assumption of Neo-Darwinism is that the inheritance of acquired
characteristics is impossible. But if inheritable variations are not always
random with respect to physiological function, then it seems to me to be more
honest to say so.

A similarly strong negative statement reinforces the separation between
evolution and development. To quote Mayr again: ‘The clarification of the
biochemical mechanisms by which the genetic program is translated into the
phenotype tells us absolutely nothing about the steps by which natural
selection has built up the particular genetic program.’

Only from this dogmatic gene-centred theory is it possible to view Neo-
Darwinism as very economical as a theory. With essentially two assumptions,
random variation and natural selection, it seemed that everything could be
explained. As Dawkins said in a debate in 2009 with one of his antagonists,
the great pioneer of the process called symbiogenesis, Lynn Margulis:

It's highly plausible, it's economical, it's parsimonious, why on earth would
you want to drag in symbiogenesis when it's such an unparsimonious,
uneconomical [theory]?

I will leave Margulis’ reply to later in this chapter. All we need to note at
the moment is that being parsimonious is not a guarantee of truth. Parsimony
is a relativistic concept, dependent on the scale we are addressing. Moreover,
as we saw in [Chapter 1](book-part1.html#CT-bp-1), quantum mechanics and
relativity theory greatly complicated the simple nineteenth-century view of
the physics of the universe. Being parsimonious didn't save it from being
falsified, however strongly and convincingly Laplace and others had presented
it. Something similar is now happening to biological science. The full details
of that process will appear in [Chapters 7](book-part7.html#CT-bp-7) and
[8](book-part8.html#CT-bp-8).

##### Extensions of the Modern Synthesis

It is important to acknowledge that evolutionary biologists have added new
processes to this list since the Modern Synthesis was formulated around 75
years ago. The discoveries that the list is incomplete occurred in various
stages over the subsequent years, and these led to various extensions.

The first extensions were based on the realisation that evolutionary change
could occur without any mutations, and even if there was no selection
pressure. Purely random variations in selection of existing gene variants
(alleles) can give rise to a process that is called random genetic drift.23

Genetic drift was extended around 1968 when the Japanese scientist Motoo
Kimura developed the idea into the neutral theory of molecular evolution.24
This theory assumed that the great majority of the differences in genome
sequences were neutral with respect to function and so would not affect the
fitness of the individual and would not therefore be selected for or against.
Most evolutionary change was therefore attributed to genetic drift. Selection
was allocated the role of removing harmful mutations.

Neither of these developments altered the basic assumption that genetic
variation was random. They were therefore relatively easy to incorporate into
the Modern Synthesis.

A more recent set of extensions has been to incorporate developmental biology
back into evolutionary theory, leading to what is widely called evolutionary
development biology (evo-devo for short). This theory is more important to the
theme of this book since it proposes that evolutionary change has occurred as
a result of changes in genetic expression patterns or through genes acquiring
different roles in new functions. In the form favoured by the American
scientist Mary Jane West-Eberhard, it also led to the idea that phenotype
change can occur before genotype change.25 The idea that genes are followers
rather than leaders in evolution will be explored further in [Chapter 8](book-
part8.html#CT-bp-8), where one of the questions will be whether the Modern
Synthesis can continue to be extended or whether it is time for replacement.

### Schrödinger and What is Life?

Erwin Schrödinger is best known for his work on quantum mechanics, where he
famously formulated the wave equation. He also worked on relativity theory and
on ways of unifying quantum mechanical and relativity views of the universe.
He gave a series of lectures at the Dublin Institute of Advanced Studies in
1942, the same year in which Julian Huxley's book was published. Those
lectures were published in 1943 with the ambitious title What is Life?. It was
a seminal adjunct to Huxley's book in two important respects. He made two
predictions, one of which was fulfilled spectacularly; the other is
necessarily incorrect.

At this point in the story it is important to note that while Mendel's work
showed that there must be genetic material somewhere within the organism and
that inheritance could be discrete, no one knew where the genetic material
would be found. When proteins were found to be amino acid polymers, they might
have been a suitable candidate. Amino acids can be organised in billions of
different sequences, so that would have been quite possible from an
information perspective. Locating it in the other main biological polymer,
DNA, was yet to come. Yet Schrödinger made the completely correct prediction
that, wherever it was found, it would turn out to be what he called an
aperiodic crystal. A crystal can be defined as molecules arranged in regular
orders. In a slightly stretched sense, a polymer is that, even if it is more
like a string than what we normally think of as a crystal. ‘Aperiodic crystal’
is also a very good description since, although there are repeats in the DNA
sequences, in fact many of them, they are not regularly repeated throughout
the genome. They are usually short sections in an otherwise information-dense
aperiodic sequence. Schrödinger realised that if the genetic molecules were to
contain sufficient information to enable an organism to develop from a single
cell, then the structural sequences of the ‘crystal’ would need to be
irregular. A regular repeating structure would contain very little information
over and above the first instance of it. This is true of all sequences. The
words of this book, for example, contain (I hope!) a lot of useful information
for you as the reader. But you would be very disappointed to open the book to
find that it consisted of the first sentence endlessly repeated.

Now we come to Schrödinger's second conclusion. If the genetic material is an
information-dense sequence, how is it read to enable the characteristics of an
organism to be transmitted from one generation to another? A one-dimensional
sequence cannot simply map a three-dimensional structure. It is not a
miniature organism in the way in which some nineteenth-century microscopists
imagined when they looked at sperm and egg cells. Could that three-dimensional
template come from somewhere else, perhaps in the three-dimensional structure
of the cell itself? Whichever way that is done, Schrödinger reasoned that the
sequence must be read in a determinate manner if it was faithfully to transmit
information. Stochasticity in a communication line is intolerable. We call it
noise, and if loud enough it can drown out the signal. From this he concluded
that there must be an absolutely fundamental difference between physics and
biology.

Physics can be characterised as order from disorder. At the micro level, there
is the essential stochasticity of quantum mechanics. Even if, one day, an
alternative view of ‘reality’ is produced, as people like Albert Einstein and
David Bohm believed, we can't escape the fact that the equations of quantum
mechanics are precisely predictive as probabilistic descriptions. Any
underlying determinism would have to reproduce this. That is not difficult to
imagine, since we already have an example of stochasticity at the molecular
level that was discovered well before quantum mechanics. In 1827 Robert Brown
observed that fine particles derived from pollen grains showed stochastic
movement in water observed under the microscope. We call it Brownian motion
and it was shown by Einstein in 1905 to arise from the random bombardment of
the particles by the random motion of water molecules, the first demonstration
of the existence of individual molecules with separate motions.

Yet, the equations of thermodynamics, which describe large numbers of
particles to generate the gas laws, are determinate. The answer to this
apparent paradox is that, if motion at the particle level is genuinely random,
then large numbers of particles will cancel their individual movements out to
produce a constant pressure when hitting an object, like the wall of a
pressure vessel. Order at large scales therefore arises from disorder at lower
scales.

But this interpretation is inconsistent with a Schrödinger view of biology in
which the genetic material at the molecular level is supposed to be read in a
determinate manner, rather as an X-ray beam can generate an accurate and
determinate ‘picture’ of a crystal by the diffraction of the rays by the
regular structure of the crystal. Biology, he reasoned, was therefore the
generation of order at large scale from order at the micro scale.26

This can't be correct, as we will see later in the story. Moreover, it is
strange given his background and great contributions to relativity theory that
Schrödinger seems to have seen no reason to view biology as the next area of
application of the general principle of relativity. His view of biology as
generating order from order across the scales must have shielded him from such
insights. It also led to the incorrect ‘read-only’ view of DNA.

### Neo-Darwinism and the Central Dogma

The scientists who developed the Modern Synthesis were brilliant and they were
amongst the most influential scientists of the twentieth century. They
formulated the best hypothesis they could that would combine the observations
and insights of Darwin and Wallace on the role of natural selection with the
discoveries of Mendel and the idea of the Weismann Barrier on genetics. As a
hypothesis, it was very successful. The study of the genetics of populations
was transformed and became a rigorously mathematical discipline.

The Modern Synthesis also fitted extremely well with the early discoveries of
molecular biology.27 Schrödinger's aperiodic crystal has become the genome.
Following the determination of the structure of DNA by James Watson, Francis
Crick, Maurice Wilkins and Rosalind Franklin in 1953, it became clear that not
only was the molecule a one-dimensional string coiled into a helical
structure, it was also impossible for there to be a one-to-one mapping between
nucleotides of DNA and the amino acids of proteins. There are only four
nucleotides used in DNA; 20 amino acids are used to make proteins. The minimum
sequence to specify an amino acid would therefore be three, since two would
only allow 16 to be coded for. This was subsequently shown to be the case, and
so the triplet code was discovered (Figure 5.2).

![](../Images/17624fig5_2.png)

Figure 5.2

The triplet code. There are only 20 amino acids normally used in proteins.
There are 64 different triplet sequences using four bases. Many of the triplet
sequences therefore code for the same amino acid. Three triplet sequences,
UAA, UAG and UGA, are used to indicate stop points (adapted from Wikipedia,
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_code>, Mikael Häggström (Public Domain
licence)).

Molecular biology was also successful in working out the way in which the
sequences are read. But the reading is one-way only. Nucleic acid sequences
code for amino acid sequences but not the other way round. This is the basis
of the formulation of the Central Dogma of molecular biology, which states
exactly that.

So, with all this success to its name, what went wrong with Neo-Darwinism? In
a single word: hubris.

What went wrong was that the Modern Synthesis became hardened into
dogmatism.28 Starting from the theory that this is the way in which evolution
could have happened, it became transformed into the conviction that this was
the only way in which evolution must have happened. I referred above to the
2009 debate between Richard Dawkins and Lynn Margulis. Margulis was the
champion of the role of symbiogenesis in the formation of eukaryotes via the
fusion of bacteria with early cells. I will now give a slightly longer section
of the transcript of that part of the debate:

Dawkins:It [Neo-Darwinism] is highly plausible, it's economical, it's
parsimonious, why on earth would you want to drag in symbiogenesis when it's
such an unparsimonious, uneconomical [theory]?

Margulis:Because it's there.

That's it in a nutshell. What is there, what exists, is the starting point of
all science.

Through many such starting points we have learnt that Nature often resists
parsimonious explanations at low levels. As we saw in the case of cardiac and
circadian rhythms in [Chapter 3](book-part3.html#CT-bp-3), multiple processes
are the rule rather than the exception. It would also have been incorrect to
have insisted that the first ‘clock’ gene to be discovered was necessarily the
only one to be involved in circadian rhythm. It is similarly incorrect to
insist that the Neo-Darwinist mechanism is the only one required to explain
evolution. As we have seen earlier in this chapter, Darwin himself did not
think that natural selection was the only mechanism.

### The Language of Neo-Darwinism29

The problems, though, run even deeper than the new (and older) experimental
evidence that the theory is incomplete in describing the known facts. Many of
the problems with the standard theory of evolution in accommodating the new
experimental findings have their origin in Neo-Darwinist metaphors and other
forms of representation rather than in experimental biology itself. These
colourful metaphors have been responsible for, and express, the way in which
twentieth-century biology has most frequently been interpreted and presented
to the public. In addition, therefore, to the need to accommodate
unanticipated experimental findings, we need to review the way in which we
interpret and communicate experimental biology. The language of Neo-Darwinism
and twentieth-century biology reflects highly reductionist philosophical and
scientific viewpoints, the concepts of which are not required by the
scientific discoveries themselves. In fact, it can be shown that, in the case
of some of the central concepts of Neo-Darwinism, such as ‘selfish genes’ or
‘genetic programme’, no biological experiment could possibly distinguish even
between completely opposite conceptual interpretations of the same
experimental findings.30 The concepts therefore form a biased interpretive
veneer that can hide those discoveries in a web of interpretation.

I refer to a web of interpretation since it is the whole conceptual scheme of
Neo-Darwinism that creates the difficulty. Each concept and metaphor
reinforces the overall mind-set until it is almost impossible to stand outside
it and to appreciate how beguiling it is. Since Neo-Darwinism has dominated
biological science for over half a century, its viewpoint is now so embedded
in the scientific literature, including standard school and university
textbooks, that many biological scientists may themselves not recognise its
conceptual nature, let alone question incoherencies or identify flaws. Many
see it as merely a description of what experimental work has shown: the idea
in a nutshell is that genes code for proteins that form organisms via a
genetic programme inherited from preceding generations and which defines and
determines the organism and its future offspring. What is wrong with that? The
remainder of this chapter explains what is wrong or misleading and, above all,
it shows that the conceptual scheme is neither required by nor any longer
productive for, the experimental science itself. Nor is it consistent with the
principle of relativity applied to multi-scale biology.

I will analyse the main concepts and the associated metaphors individually,
and then show how they link together to form the complete narrative. We can
then move on in [Chapters 7](book-part7.html#CT-bp-7) and [8](book-
part8.html#CT-bp-8) to ask what would be an alternative approach better fitted
to what we now know experimentally and to a new more integrated systems view
of the processes of living organisms and of their evolution. The terms that
require analysis are ‘gene’, ‘selfish’, ‘code’, ‘programme’, ‘blueprint’ and
‘book of life’. We also need to examine secondary concepts like ‘replicator’
and ‘vehicle’.

##### ‘Gene’

As we have seen, Neo-Darwinism is a gene-centred theory of evolution. Yet its
central notion, the ‘gene’, is an unstable concept. Surprising as it may seem,
there is no single agreed definition of ‘gene’.31 Even more seriously, the
different definitions have incompatible consequences for the theory.32

Johannsen's original definition, GeneJ – the necessary cause of a trait. The
word ‘gene’ was introduced by Johannsen in 1909. But the concept had already
existed since Mendel's experiments on plant hybrids, published in 1866, and
was based on what one of the great thinkers of Neo-Darwinism, Ernst Mayr,
described in 1982 as ‘the silent assumption [that] was made almost universally
that there is a 1:1 relation between genetic factor (gene) and character’. Of
course, no one now thinks that there is a simple 1:1 relation, but the
language of direct causation has been retained.

I will call this definition of a ‘gene’ geneJ to signify Johannsen's (but
essentially also Mendel's) meaning. Since then, the concept of a gene has
changed fundamentally. GeneJ referred to the cause of a specific inheritable
phenotype characteristic (trait), such as eye/hair/skin colour, body shape and
weight, number of legs/arms/wings, to which we could perhaps add more complex
traits such as intelligence, personality and sexuality.

The modern molecular biological definition of a gene, GeneM – a sequence of
DNA that is transcribed to produce a functional product. The molecular
biological definition of a gene is very different. Following the discovery
that DNA forms templates for proteins, the definition shifted to locatable DNA
sequences with identifiable beginnings and endings. Complexity was added
through the discovery of regulatory elements (essentially switches), but the
basic cause of phenotype characteristics was still thought to be the DNA
sequence, since that forms the template to determine which protein is made,
which in turn interacts with the rest of the organism to produce the
phenotype. I will call this definition of a ‘gene’ geneM (see Figure 5.3).

![](../Images/17624fig5_3.png)

Figure 5.3

Relations between genes, environment and phenotype characters according to
current physiological and biochemical understanding. This diagram represents
the interaction between DNA sequences, environment and phenotype as occurring
through biological networks. The causation occurs in both directions between
all three influences on the networks. This view is very different from the
idea that genes ‘cause’ the phenotype (right hand arrow). This diagram also
helps to explain the difference between the original concept of a gene as the
cause of a particular phenotype (geneJ) and the modern definition as a DNA
sequence (geneM).33

The important point here is that geneJ and geneM are not the same thing and
their causal relationships to the phenotype are fundamentally different.34
They could only be the same thing if all phenotype characteristics were
attributable entirely to DNA sequences. As we have seen in [Chapter 4](book-
part4.html#CT-bp-4), this is not the case. DNA does not act outside the
context of a complete cell. The complete cell is also necessary.

The causal relationships are also completely different. According to the
original view, genesJ were necessarily the cause of inheritable phenotypes
since that is how they were defined: as whatever in the organism is the cause
of that phenotype. Johannsen even left the question of what that might be
vague: ‘the gene was something very uncertain, “ein Etwas” (“a something” in
German), with no connection to the chromosomes’. Dawkins, in 1982, also used
this ‘catch-all’ definition as ‘an inheritable unit’.35 It would not matter
whether that was DNA or something else or any combination of factors. No
experiment could disprove a ‘catch-all’ concept since any new discovery as a
cause of the phenotype to be included would be welcomed as a geneJ. The idea
becomes completely unfalsifiable. It cannot be tested.

By contrast, defining genes as sequences of DNA makes the question of
causation become an empirical investigation. To appreciate the difference,
consider Mendel's experiments showing specific phenotypes, such as smooth or
wrinkled surfaces of peas. GeneJ was whatever in the plant caused the peas to
be smooth or wrinkled. It would not make sense to ask whether geneJ was the
cause. That is how it was defined. It simply is everything that determines the
inherited phenotype, i.e. the trait. Of course, different questions of an
empirical nature could be asked about genesJ, such as whether they follow
Mendel's laws. Some do; some don't. By contrast it makes perfect sense to ask
whether a specific DNA sequence, geneM, is involved in determining the
phenotype. That question is open to experimental investigation. GeneJ could
only be the same as geneM if DNA alone determined the phenotype.

This difference between geneJ (which refers to indeterminate entities that are
necessarily the cause) and geneM (whose causation is open to experimentation)
is central and I will use it several times in this book. The difference is in
fact large since most changes in DNA do not necessarily cause a change in
phenotype. Organisms are very good at buffering themselves against genomic
change – 80% of gene (meaning DNA) knockouts in yeast, for example, are
normally silent, while critical biological oscillators like the cardiac
pacemaker or circadian rhythm are buffered against genomic change through
extensive back-up mechanisms, as we saw in [Chapter 3](book-part3.html#CT-
bp-3).

The original concept of a gene has therefore been adopted, but then
significantly changed by molecular biology. This led to a great clarification
of molecular mechanisms, surely one of the greatest triumphs of twentieth-
century biology, and widely acknowledged as such. But the more philosophical
consequences of this change for higher-level biology are profound and they are
much less widely understood. Figure 5.3 illustrates the difference.

Some biological scientists have even given up using the word ‘gene’, except in
inverted commas. The popular idea that a ‘gene’ is a concrete reality is no
longer useful. That change is best illustrated by asking why the precise
definition matters.

Why does the definition of a gene matter? A central feature of gene-centred
evolutionary theory is that genes are not only the determinants of the
organism and the object of selection, they are also isolated from influences
of the environment. Genes are seen as unique in being transmitted as
‘immortal’ elements from one generation to the next via the process of
replication. As the replicator they are distinct from the rest of the organism
which, from the genes-eye view, is merely the carrier, the ‘vehicle’, by which
they are transmitted.

The reason that the original and the molecular biological definitions of a
gene have incompatible consequences for Neo-Darwinism is that only the
molecular biological definition, geneM, could be compatible with such a strict
separation between the ‘replicator’ and the ‘vehicle’. As illustrated in
Figure 5.3, a definition in terms of inheritable phenotypic characteristics
(i.e. geneJ) necessarily includes much more than the DNA, so that the
distinction between replicator and vehicle is no longer valid. Note also that
the change in definition of a gene that I am referring to here is more
fundamental than some other changes that are required by recent findings in
genomics, such as the 80% of ‘non-coding’ DNA that is now known to be
transcribed and which also might be included in the molecular biological
definition. Those findings raise an empirical question: are those
transcriptions as RNAs functional? That would extend geneM to include these
additional functional sequences. The difference I refer to, by contrast, is a
conceptual one. The difference between geneJ and geneM would still be
fundamental since it is the difference between necessary and empirically
testable causality, not just an extension of the definition of geneM.

This fundamental difference does not seem to have been understood by those who
popularised Neo-Darwinism. Yet it is critical to the concepts of ‘replicator’
and ‘vehicle’.

##### ‘Selfish Gene’36

It is also critical to the colourful metaphor of the ‘selfish gene’. On
selfish gene theory, genes as DNA sequences are rather like viruses exploiting
the carrier organism for their own selfish aims. The metaphor doesn't work for
the original definition of a gene since, as we have seen, that included non-
DNA parts of the organism. If there is no clear boundary between the gene and
the phenotype by which it is expressed, then what is selfishly exploiting
what? GeneJ is necessarily defined in terms of the phenotype that is being
exploited.

So, can the metaphor work for the molecular definition of a gene? The best way
to answer this question is to apply the acid test of any scientific theory,
which is to compare it with an opposite theory and ask whether there is an
experiment that could be performed to distinguish which is correct. There are
various possible opposites that can be used to carry out this test. For
example, we could follow Maynard Smith and Eors Szathmary, who wrote in 1999
that ‘they [genes] are all in the same boat’, which portrays genes as elements
that have been imprisoned in the boat and must co-operate to survive.

What we find when we carry out this test is that there is no biological
experiment that could distinguish between the selfish gene theory and its
opposites, such as ‘imprisoned’ or ‘co-operative’ genes. This point was
implicitly conceded long ago by Richard Dawkins in his 1982 book The Extended
Phenotype, where he wrote ‘I doubt that there is any experiment that could
prove my claim.’37

Genes defined as DNA sequences are rather like the symbols of a written
language which in themselves have no meaning other than that which is given to
them by the users of the language. That is why we are completely baffled by
unfamiliar scripts. Until we learn the meanings that are attached to them by
the language users, they are mere ciphers. Knowing the letters of the English
alphabet does not in itself guarantee that one can understand the works of
Shakespeare, or even the talk of a young child. Moreover, the same sequence
can have totally different meanings in different contexts within the same
language (compare, for example, the English word ‘just’ in ‘just a minute’ and
‘a just war’) and even more so in different languages (compare ‘but’ in
English, translated as ‘mais’ in French, with ‘but’ in French, translated as
‘goal’ in English). DNA sequences are precisely like this. Their meanings in
terms of phenotype expression have completely changed during the course of
evolution, and they may also change during the life history of a single
organism. Many DNA sequences that are necessary for us to have arms and legs
first arose in organisms that have neither. The ‘language of the genes’ has
itself evolved. And the key to understanding this ‘language’ is not at the
level of DNA. It is at the level of the phenotype. It is the phenotype that
can give meaning (function) to DNA sequences.

Could this problem be avoided by attaching a meaning to ‘selfish’ as applied
to DNA sequences that is independent of meanings in terms of phenotype? For
example, we could say that a DNA sequence is ‘selfish’ to the extent to which
its frequency in subsequent generations is increased. This at least would be
an objective definition which could be measured in terms of population
genetics. But wait a minute! The whole point of the characterisation of a gene
as selfish is precisely that this property leads to its success in reproducing
itself. We cannot make the prediction of a theory be the basis of the
definition of the central element of the theory. If we do that, the theory is
empty from the viewpoint of empirical science.38

##### ‘Code’

After the discovery of the double helical structure of DNA, it was found that
each sequence of three bases in DNA or RNA corresponds to a single amino acid
in a protein sequence. As we saw earlier in this chapter (Figure 5.2), these
triplet patterns are formed from any combination of the four bases U, C, A and
G in RNA and T, C, A and G in DNA. They are often described as the genetic
‘code’, but it is important to understand that this usage of the word ‘code’
carries overtones that can be confusing.

A code was originally an intentional encryption used by humans to communicate.
The genetic ‘code’ is not intentional in that sense. The word ‘code’ has
unfortunately reinforced the idea that genes are active and even complete
causes, in much the same way as a computer is caused to follow the
instructions of a computer program. The more neutral word ‘template’ would be
better. Templates are used only when required (activated); they are not
themselves active causes. The active causes lie within the cells themselves
since they determine the expression patterns for the different cell types and
states. These patterns are communicated to the DNA by transcription factors,
by methylation patterns and by binding to the tails of histones, all of which
influence the pattern and speed of transcription of different parts of the
genome. If the word ‘instruction’ is useful at all, it is rather that the cell
instructs the genome. As Barbara McClintock wrote in 1984 after receiving her
Nobel Prize, the genome is an ‘organ of the cell’, not the other way round.

Realising that DNA is under the control of the system has been re-inforced by
the discovery that cells use different start, stop and splice sites for
producing different messenger RNAs from a single DNA sequence. This enables
the same sequence to encode different proteins in different cell types and
under different conditions.

Representing the direction of causality in biology the wrong way round is
therefore confusing and has far-reaching consequences. The causality is
circular, acting both ways: passive causality by DNA sequences acting as
otherwise inert templates, and active causality by the functional networks of
interactions that determine how the genome is activated.

##### ‘Programme’

I was one of the first biological scientists to use the early valve-based
machines called computers in 1960. They consisted of vast arrays of thousands
of valves (a device functionally equivalent to a transistor in which the
electrons moved through a vacuum rather than through a semiconductor),
requiring large amounts of space and a lot of electricity. There was no
screen, no ‘windows’, and they were programmed with gibberish code written on
long rolls of paper or magnetic tape. Their use was restricted to large-scale
mathematical calculations of the kind needed in astronomy, particle physics,
theoretical chemistry and (very rarely indeed at that time) biology.

The electromagnetic storage space in the machine was small, so the program had
to be entered into the machine by running the tape through a tape reader. It
is easy therefore for scientists like me to understand why, when the idea of a
‘genetic programme’ was introduced by the French Nobel laureates Jacques Monod
and Francois Jacob, they referred specifically to the way in which early
electronic computers were programmed by paper or magnetic tapes: ‘The
programme is a model borrowed from electronic computers. It equates the
genetic material with the magnetic tape of a computer.’ The analogy was that
DNA ‘programmes’ the cell, tissues and organs of the body just as the code in
a computer program causally determines what the computer does. In principle,
the code is independent of the machine that implements it, in the sense that
the code itself is sufficient to specify what will happen when the
instructions are satisfied. If the program specifies a mathematical
computation, for example, it would contain a specification of the computation
to be performed in the form of complete algorithms. The problem is that no
complete algorithms can be found in the DNA sequences. What we find is better
characterised as a mixture of templates and switches. The ‘templates’ are the
triplet sequences that specify the amino acid sequences or the RNA sequences.
The ‘switches’ are the locations on the DNA or histones where transcription
factors, methylation and other controlling processes trigger their effects. As
a programme, this is incomplete.

Where, then, does the full algorithmic logic of a programme lie? Where, for
example, do we find the equivalent of ‘IF–THEN–ELSE’ type instructions? The
answer is in the cell or organism as a whole, not just in the genome. In his
1970 book, La Logique du Vivant, Jacob recognised this when he wrote ‘the
incessant execution of a programme is inseparable from its realisation’, and
it was expressed even more clearly by Enrico Coen in his 1999 book The Art of
Genes: ‘Organisms are not simply manufactured according to a set of
instructions.’ Much earlier, in 1986, Adam Wilkins wrote: ‘If the genome were
a program…it would contain instructions on where the information selection
process is to begin and it would specify the rules for the successive
selection steps. None of that information is in the genome, at least in any
form that can be presently recognised.’39 Thirty years later, after intensive
genome sequence analysis, it still has not been found.

Take as an example circadian rhythm as described in [Chapter 3](book-
part3.html#CT-bp-3). The simplest version of this process depends on a DNA
sequence, Period, used as a template for the production of a protein PER whose
concentration then builds up in the cytoplasm. It diffuses through the nuclear
membrane and, as the nuclear level increases, it inhibits the transcription of
Period. This is a negative feedback loop of the kind that can be represented
as implementing a ‘programme’ like

IF LEVEL X EXCEEDS Y STOP PRODUCING X,

BUT IF LEVEL X IS SMALLER THAN Y

THEN CONTINUE PRODUCING X.

But it is important to note that the implementation of this ‘programme’ to
produce a 24-hour rhythm depends on rates of protein production by ribosomes,
rates of change of concentrations within the cytoplasm, rates of transport
across the nuclear membrane and speed of interaction with the gene
transcription control site (the switch). All of this is necessary to produce a
feedback circuit that depends on much more than the genome. It depends also on
the intricate cellular, tissue and organ structures that are not specified by
DNA sequences, which replicate themselves via self-templating, and which are
also essential to inheritance across cell and organism generations.

This is true of all such ‘programmes’. To call them ‘genetic programmes’ or
‘gene networks’ is to fuel the misconception that all the active causal
determination lies in the one-dimensional DNA sequences. It doesn't. It also
lies in the three-dimensional static and dynamic structures of the cells,
tissues and organs.

The postulate of a ‘genetic programme’ led to the idea that an organism is
fully defined by its genome, whereas in fact the inheritance of cell structure
is equally important. Moreover, this structure is specific to different
species. Cross-species clones do not generally work. A rare example is work
done in China by Yonghua Sun and his colleagues in 2005 using two different
species of fish, where the nucleus of one species was used to replace the
nucleus in a fertilised egg cell of the other species. The outcome in the
anatomy of the adult that resulted from this cross was determined by the
cytoplasmic structures and expression patterns of the egg cells, as well as
the transferred DNA (Figure 5.4). The basic features of structural
organisation both of cells and of multicellular organisms must have been
determined by physical constraints before the relevant genomic information was
developed.

Figure 5.4

was transferred into the enucleated egg cell of a goldfish, Carassius auratus
(left). The result is a cross-species clone (right) with a vertebral number
closer to that of a goldfish (26–28) than of a carp (33–36) and with a more
rounded body than a carp. The bottom illustrations are X-ray images of the
animals in the top illustration (figure kindly provided by Professor Yonghua
Sun from the work of Sun et al. (2005)).40

As with the word ‘code’, the purpose of this section is to warn against
simplistic interpretations of the implications of the word ‘programme’. In the
extended uses to which the word has been put in biology, and in modern
computing science where the concept of a distributed program is normal,
‘programme’ can be used in many different ways. The point is that such a
‘programme’ does not lie in the DNA alone. That is also the reason why the
concept of a ‘genetic programme’ is not testable. By necessarily including
non-DNA elements, there is no way of determining whether a ‘genetic programme’
exists. In the limit, when all the relevant components have been added, the
‘programme’ is the same as the function it is supposed to be programming. The
concept then becomes redundant.

##### ‘Blueprint’

‘Blueprint’ is a variation on the idea of a programme. The word suffers from a
similar problem to the concept of a ‘programme’, which is that it can be
mistaken to imply that all the information necessary for the construction of
an organism lies in the DNA. This is clearly not true. The complete cell is
also required, and its complex structures are inherited by self-templating.
The ‘blueprint’, therefore, is the cell as a whole. But that destroys the
whole idea of the genome being the full specification. It also blurs and
largely nullifies the distinction between replicator and vehicle in selfish
gene theory.

##### ‘Book of Life’

The genome is often described as the ‘book of life’. This was one of the
colourful metaphors used when projecting the idea of sequencing the complete
human genome. It was a brilliant public relations move. Who could not be
intrigued by reading the ‘book of life’ and unravelling its secrets? And who
could resist the promise that, within about a decade, that book would reveal
how to treat cancer, heart disease, nervous diseases and diabetes, with a new
era of pharmaceutical targets. As we all know, it didn't happen. An editorial
in Nature in 2010 (which inspired a similar editorial in Prospect)41 spelt
this out:

But for all the intellectual ferment of the past decade, has human health
truly benefited from the sequencing of the human genome? A startlingly honest
response can be found on pages 674 and 676, where the leaders of the public
and private efforts, Francis Collins and Craig Venter, both say ‘not much’.

The ‘book of life’ represents the high watermark of the enthusiasm with which
the language of Neo-Darwinism was developed. Its failure to deliver the
promised advances in healthcare speaks volumes.42 Of course, there were very
good scientific reasons for sequencing whole genomes. The benefits to
evolutionary and comparative biology in particular have been immense, and the
sequencing of genomes may well eventually contribute to healthcare when the
sequences can be better understood in the context of other essential aspects
of physiological function. But the promise of a peep into the ‘book of life’
leading to a cure for all diseases was a mistake.

### The Language of Neo-Darwinism as a Whole

All parts of the Neo-Darwinist forms of representation encourage the use and
acceptance of the other parts. Once one accepts the idea that the DNA and RNA
templates form a ‘code’, the idea of the ‘genetic programme’ follows
naturally. That leads on to statements like ‘they [genes] created us body and
mind’, which gets causality wrong in two ways. First, it represents genes as
active causes, whereas they are passive templates. Second, it ignores the many
feedbacks onto the genome that contribute to circular causality, in which
causation runs in both directions. Those mistakes automatically lead to the
distinction between replicators and vehicles. The problem begins in accepting
the first step, the idea that there is a ‘code’ forming a complete programme.

The distinction between the replicator and the vehicle can be seen as the
culmination of the Neo-Darwinist way of thinking. If all the algorithms for
the processes of life lie in the genome, then the rest of the organism does
seem to be a disposable vehicle. Only the genome needs to replicate, leaving
any old vehicle to carry it.

The distinction, however, is a linguistic confusion and it is incorrect
experimentally. The DNA passed on from one generation to the next is based on
copies (though not always perfect). The cell that carries the DNA is also a
copy (also not always perfect). In order for a cell to give rise to daughter
cells, both the DNA and the cell have to be copied. The only difference
between copying a cell and copying DNA is that the cell copies itself by
growing (copying its own detailed structure gradually, which is an example of
self-templating) and then dividing so that each daughter cell has a full
complement of the complex cell machinery and its organelles, whereas copying
DNA for the purpose of inheritance occurs only when the cell is dividing.
Moreover, the complexity of the structure in each case is comparable. When we
calculate the amount of information contained in the three-dimensional
structure of a cell, it is easy to represent it as containing as much
information as the genome. Faithful genome replication also depends on the
prior ability of the cell to replicate itself since it is the cell that
contains the necessary structures and processes to enable errors in DNA
replication to be corrected. The process of self-templating must have
developed prior to the development of the relevant DNA.

My germ line cells are therefore just as much ‘immortal’ (or not) as their
DNA. Moreover, nearly all of my cells and DNA die with me. Those that do
survive, which are the germ cells and DNA that help to form the next
generation, do not do so separately. DNA does not work without a cell. It is
simply an incorrect playing with words to single the DNA out as uniquely
immortal.

I was also playing with words when I wrote in 2006 in The Music of Life that
‘DNA alone is inert, dead.’ But at least that has a point in actual
experiments. DNA alone does nothing. By contrast, cells can continue to
function for some time without DNA. Some cells do that naturally, e.g. red
blood cells, which live for about 100 days without DNA. Others, such as
isolated nerve axons, fibroblasts or any other enucleated cell type, can do so
in physiological experiments.

GenesM are best viewed therefore as causes in a passive sense. They do nothing
until activated,43 just as the note on the musical score is not a sound until
you hit the keyboard or pluck the string or bang the drum. Active causation
lies with proteins, membranes, metabolites, organelles, etc. and the dynamic
functional networks they form in interaction with the environment.

Notice also that the language as a whole is strongly anthropomorphic. This is
strange, given that most Neo-Darwinists would surely wish to avoid
anthropomorphising scientific discovery.

### Conclusions

The conclusions of this chapter are twofold.

First, the Neo-Darwinist mechanism involving blind chance variations (copy
errors, radiation damage, etc.) followed by natural selection is far from a
complete description of what has been found experimentally. We will consider
the experimental evidence in more detail in [Chapters 7](book-part7.html#CT-
bp-7) and [8](book-part8.html#CT-bp-8), where we will also examine the extent
to which Neo-Darwinism itself has been tested experimentally.

Second, the language of Neo-Darwinism is itself a powerful barrier to the
development of a more inclusive theory. [Chapters 7](book-part7.html#CT-bp-7)
and [8](book-part8.html#CT-bp-8) will explore more inclusive theories. But
first we must state the main principles of Biological Relativity, which is the
subject of the [next chapter](book-part6.html#CT-bp-6).

Considering the many conceptual problems created by the language of Neo-
Darwinism, I even thought about avoiding words like ‘gene’ and ‘code’ in this
book. Some biologists already do that.44 But these words are now so deeply
ingrained in biology that it can be left to future generations to decide
whether to change. I continue to use them while emphasising their
limitations.45

### Notes

1 After finishing The Origin of Species, Darwin wrote to Charles Lyell: ‘I
suppose that I am a very slow thinker, for you would be surprised at the
number of years it took me to see clearly what some of the problems were,
which had to be solved, – such as the necessity of the principle of divergence
of character – the extinction of intermediate varieties on a continuous area
with graduated conditions, – the double problem of sterile first crosses &
sterile hybrids, &c &c. –’

2 Wallace knew of Darwin's work, and sent his essay on natural selection to
Darwin before its publication. The main difference between them was that
‘Wallace was more strictly selectionist than Darwin, who allowed a role for
other causes of change’. See <http://wallace-online.org/Wallace-Bio-
Sketch_John_van_Wyhe.html>. Not surprisingly, therefore, Wallace became a Neo-
Darwinist. It is not conceivable that the Darwin of The Origin of Species and
The Variation of Animals and Plants Under Domestication could have done so.
Those books explicitly acknowledge Lamarckian mechanisms and the second one
even proposes a theory that is remarkably similar to modern evidence on
transgenerational epigenetics.

3 (20 August 1858) Journal of the Proceedings of the Linnean Society of
London: Zoology 3:45–50.

4 It is often said that Darwin took a long time to publish The Origin of
Species because he was afraid of the outcry it would create and only published
when it became necessary because of Wallace's work. The historical evidence is
not consistent with this idea. See van Wyhe, John (2007) Mind the gap: did
Darwin avoid publishing his theory for many years? Notes and Records of the
Royal Society 61:177–205. A rather different interpretation can be found in
Richards, R.J. (2015) Myth 11: that Darwin worked on his theory in secret for
twenty years, his fears causing him to delay publication. In Newton's Apple
and Other Myths About Science. R.L. Numbers and K. Kampourakis, editors
(Harvard University Press, Cambridge, MA; pp. 88–95). While agreeing that he
was not ‘paralyzed by fear’ he was cautious to delay publication to be more
sure of his ground.

5 The preface to the fourth edition is entitled ‘An Historical Sketch of the
Recent Progress of Opinion on The Origin of Species’. There is also reference
to Darwin's grandfather, Erasmus Darwin: ‘It is curious how largely my
grandfather, Dr Erasmus Darwin, anticipated the views and erroneous grounds of
opinion of Lamarck in his “Zoonomia”’.

6 See also the glossary entry on Lamarckism.

7 This kind of inheritance commonly occurs in plants when a sport arises. A
sport is a new morphology that is displayed by part of a plant, which can be
changes in colour, flowers, leaves or branching. New plants with the changed
morphology can be created from cuttings. The morphology is inherited, although
sometimes there is reversion to the original form. The new form is therefore
not necessarily stable. This is characteristic of epigenetic inheritance in
general. But sometimes the changes are permanent and can be the basis of
speciation.

8 The gemmule theory of pangenesis is found in Darwin's 1868 book The
Variation of Animals and Plants Under Domestication.

9 A remarkable example of such a parallel to Darwin's gemmule idea comes from
the work of Corrado Spadafora's laboratory. Cossetti, C. (2014) Soma-to-
germline transmission of RNA in mice xenografted with human tumour cells:
possible transport by exosomes. PLoS ONE 9(7):e101629: ‘These results indicate
that somatic RNA is transferred to sperm cells, which can therefore act as the
final recipients of somatic cell-derived information.’

10 A good example is in a letter that Darwin sent to Moritz Wagner in 1876:
‘In my opinion, the greatest error which I have committed, has not been
allowing sufficient weight to the direct action of the environment, i.e. food,
climate, etc., independently of natural selection.’ It is significant that
this was written later than the preface to the fourth edition of The Origin of
Species. His doubts seem to have increased with time. Note that he refers to
the direct action of the environment, independently of natural selection.

11 The emphasis is mine.

12 Romanes actually introduced the term to distance himself from Neo-
Darwinism!

13 This mistake was inherent in Weismann's reactions to the nineteenth-century
Neo-Lamarckians. His response (1893) to Herbert Spencer, for example, was
entitled Die Allmacht der Naturzuchtung (the all-sufficiency of natural
selection). He wrote ‘We accept it [Allmacht]…simply because we must, because
it is the only plausible explanation that we can conceive.’ He admitted that
it was not possible to observe the process in detail, so there could be no
experimental proof, but continued: ‘It does not matter whether I am able to do
so or not, or whether I could do it well or ill; once it is established that
natural selection is the only principle which has to be considered, it
necessarily follows that the facts can be correctly explained by natural
selection.’ For further details on the history of these nineteenth-century
debates, see Gould, Stephen Jay (2002) The Structure of Evolutionary Theory
(Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, Cambridge, MA; pp. 170–250).

14 The precise meaning of the Central Dogma has been much debated. See
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_dogma_of_molecular_biology>. See also
[Chapter 7](book-part7.html#CT-bp-7) of this book, where I list the main
misinterpretations of the Central Dogma.

15 This kind of dogmatism still flourishes on the internet. There are many
blogsites that ridicule, and even libellously insult, those who dissent from
standard evolutionary theory.

16 In his book Evolutionary Genetics, John Maynard Smith admits (p. 9) ‘it is
not clear why he thought it [Weismann's claim that the germ line is
independent of the soma] was true’. Smith, John Maynard (1998) Evolutionary
Genetics, 2nd edition (Oxford University Press, Oxford).

17 See Weismann, August (1889) Essays Upon Heredity (Clarendon Press, Oxford).

18 Recent research has, however, shown that this is not strictly true. Many
genes are involved in eye colour and there can be intermediate colours:
[www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/02/070222180729.htm](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/02/070222180729.htm).

19 Mendel himself showed, however, that this ratio does not always hold. Later
(1902) studies by Walter Weldon also showed that there could be a continuous
variation in pea colour and a continuous variation in pea shape. See
Kampourakis, K. (2015) Myth 16: that Gregor Mendel was a lonely pioneer of
genetics, being ahead of his time. In Newton's Apple and Other Myths About
Science. R.L. Numbers and K. Kampourakis, editors (Harvard University Press,
Cambridge, MA; pp. 129–138): ‘It thus appeared that in obtaining purebred
plants for his experiments, Mendel actually eliminated all natural variation
in peas.’ An echo of this important point will be found in my description of
Conrad Waddington's experiments in [Chapter 8](book-part8.html#CT-bp-8).
Waddington correctly noted the difference between experiments performed on
wild populations and inbred lines.

20 R.A. Fisher in 1936 notably questioned Mendel's accuracy in reporting his
results. A careful historical analysis of this issue was published by
Fairbanks, D.J. and B. Rytting (2001) Mendelian controversies: a botanical and
historical review. American Journal of Botany 88:737–752. They conclude that
Mendel correctly described his results.

26 Schrödinger wrote (What is Life? p. 101): ‘We seem to arrive at the
ridiculous conclusion that the clue to understanding of life is that it is
based on a pure mechanism, a ‘clock-work’ in the sense of Planck's paper’ (he
is referring to Planck, M. (1917) Dynamische und statistische Gesetzmäßigkeit.
Zeitschrift fur Elektrochemie und angewandte physikalische Chemie 23:63). He
continues ‘The conclusion is not ridiculous and is, in my opinion, not
entirely wrong, but it has to be taken “with a very big grain of salt”’. He
then explains the ‘big grain of salt’ by showing that even clock-work is,
‘after all statistical’ (p. 103). My reading of these last pages of
Schrödinger's book is that he realises that something is not quite right but
is struggling to identify what it might be. We would now say that the
molecules involved (DNA) are subject to statistical variation (copying errors,
chemical and radiation damage, etc.), which are then corrected by the protein
machinery that enables DNA to be a highly reproducible molecule. This is a
three-stage process that reduces the error rate from 1 in 104 to around 1 in
1010, which is an astonishing degree of accuracy. The order at the molecular
scale is therefore actually created by the system as a whole. This requires
energy, of course, which Schrödinger called negative entropy. Perhaps
therefore this is what Schrödinger was struggling towards, but we can only see
this more clearly in retrospect. He could not have known how much the genetic
molecular material experiences stochasticity and is constrained to be highly
reproducible by the organism itself.

27 Both Crick and Watson acknowledged the great influence of Schrödinger's
What is Life?. See Moore, W. (1989) Schrödinger: Life and Thought (Cambridge
University Press, Cambridge; pp 403–404).

28 Eldredge and Gould expressed this by saying that the Modern Synthesis
became hardened: Eldredge, N. and S.J. Gould (1972) Punctuated equilibria: an

editor (Freeman, Cooper and Co., San Francisco, CA; pp. 82–115). See also

Experimental Biology, 218:7–13.

30 As an example consider the following two paragraphs:

Now they swarm in huge colonies, safe inside gigantic lumbering robots, sealed
off from the outside world, communicating with it by tortuous indirect routes,
manipulating it by remote control. They are in you and me; they created us
body and mind; and their preservation is the ultimate rationale for our
existence.

(The Selfish Gene, 1976, p. 21)

Now they are trapped in huge colonies, locked inside highly intelligent
beings, molded by the outside world, communicating with it by complex
processes, through which, blindly, as if by magic, function emerges. They are
in you and me; we are the system that allows their code to be read; and their
preservation is totally dependent on the joy we experience in reproducing
ourselves. We are the ultimate rationale for their existence.

(The Music of Life, 2006, p. 12)

Apart from the obviously true statement ‘they are in you and me’ the
statements are diametrically opposed. Yet no conceivable experiment could
distinguish between them. See Noble, D. (2011) Neo-Darwinism, the Modern
Synthesis, and selfish genes: are they of use in physiology? Journal of
Physiology 589:1007–1015.

31 Keller, Evelyn Fox (2000) The Century of the Gene (Harvard University
Press, Cambridge, MA): ‘As we listen to the ways in which the term is now used
by working biologists, we find that the gene has become many things – no
longer a single entity but a word with great plasticity, defined only by the
specific experimental context in which it is used’ (p. 69).

32 The problems arising from conflating different definitions of ‘gene’ have
also been noted in Moss, L. (2004) What Genes Can't Do (MIT Press, Cambridge,
MA).

33 This diagram needs to be understood in the context of the text explaining
the different definitions of a gene and the role of networks in buffering
genetic changes. The distinction between phenotype and DNA is itself
problematic. DNA is part of the phenotype (McClintock: ‘The genome is an organ
of the cell’).

34 Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. Also John Dupré, who advocates ‘an
atheoretical pluralism’ that abandons any pretence to a ‘theoretical core to
the concept’: simply, ‘a gene is any bit of DNA that anyone has reason to name
and keep track of’ (pp. 332–333). Dupré, John (2004) Understanding

36 At the time of writing (2015) I believe it is correct to say that most
professional biologists no longer regard the version of evolutionary theory
presented in The Selfish Gene as sufficient or, in its popular version, even
relevant. The metaphor, and indeed the whole book, continues however to be
deeply influential in other fields, particularly in the social sciences and
humanities. It is still therefore necessary to explain what is wrong with it
in biological science. My analysis complements that of Midgley, Mary (2010)

45 There is no fully agreed definition of ‘gene’. The important point here is
that the different definitions of a gene have their strong points and can each
be useful in the context appropriate to them. But we should not conflate or
confuse them since their consequences are incompatible.



## 6 Biological Relativity

He would be unable to determine, how all the parts are modified by the general
nature of blood, and are compelled by it to adapt themselves.1

Benedict de Spinoza, 1665 Letter to Henry Oldenburg, first Secretary of the
Royal Society

We arrive now at the point in our story at which the central principle of this
book will be laid out. The principle of Biological Relativity is simply that
there is no privileged level of causation in biology: living organisms are
multi-level open stochastic systems in which the behaviour at any level
depends on higher and lower levels and cannot be fully understood in
isolation. Just as Special Relativity and General Relativity can be succinctly
phrased by saying that there is no global (privileged) frame of reference,
Biological Relativity can be phrased as saying that there is no global frame
of causality in organisms.

Darwin made the first step in this approach when he proposed that speciation
could only be understood in terms of the complete ecosystem (to use modern
terminology).2 The principle of Biological Relativity takes this view to its
logical conclusions. One of the mistakes made in Neo-Darwinism was to isolate
one part of the ‘molecular’ level as though it were the whole story, rather
than an important part.

Although I will often illustrate the consequences of the principle of
Biological Relativity by singling out the molecular, gene-centric form of
reductionism (which is the most prevalent form of reductionism), it is
important to note at the outset that any form of unwarranted explanatory
reductionism is the chief intellectual problem addressed by the theory of
Biological Relativity. As an example, the spiral arrhythmia in the heart,
discussed in [Chapter 3](book-part3.html#CT-bp-3), will appear random and
inexplicable at the level of single cells. The order and explanation exist
only at the level of the whole organ. In this case the lower level of cells is
already one at which the events appear random, without having to go further
down to the molecular level.

But why should I be taking you on this journey? What are my credentials for
doing so?3

### A Personal Journey

I have often been asked how I arrived at an integrative and relativistic view
of biology, particularly since I started my research career investigating
protein ion channels in excitable cell membranes, which was clearly viewed as
a reductionist project in the context of more systems-oriented physiology. I
come therefore from the reductionist camp. I know and have experienced and
been excited by its great strengths. But, for that same reason, I also know
its limitations from the inside.

This chapter therefore begins with a story from my own student days at
University College London. I went there in 1955 from a London working class
tailoring family and was the first member of my family ever to go to
university. In those days only 5% of the population benefited from such
privilege. It felt like a privilege too. UCL was packed with household names
in the various sciences, philosophy, mathematics and many other disciplines.4
The successes of the reductionist approach were also very apparent. I remember
seeing the first images using electron microscopy from Hugh Huxley's work
showing the individual protein molecular filaments responsible for muscle
contraction. And I could witness the excitement of Bernard Katz's work showing
the quantal nature of neuro-muscular transmission.

Sadly, just as I was beginning to push my family's experience to such heights
of intellectual endeavour, we suddenly became much poorer through the
relatively early death of my father. We became a single-parent family, and
there were three younger brothers to bring up. Paying the family's electricity
bills from what remained of a student grant was not easy. I shared with our
mother the weekly anxieties of managing on very tight budgets. I was not to
know then that the youngest brother, Ray, would many years later become one of
the most charismatic members of the distinguished faculty at UCL. The
significance of that outcome for this book will become clearer in the last
chapter. In fact, it infuses the whole of this book since many of the ideas
arise from discussions he and I have had over many years.

It was impossible also after that tragic event to imagine how my own career
would eventually develop, and even whether I could continue as a student at
UCL. When you are trying to make ends meet financially you don't see much
beyond the end of each week. The hardship, though, had one very beneficial
effect for me. My life had to focus entirely around the family, the academic
work and the long cycling journeys across London between the two. With no
money left over, student social life became an unnecessary luxury, but
therefore no longer a distraction.

It was therefore very fortunate that I won a prestigious Bayliss-Starling
scholarship providing the full funding to go on to do graduate work towards a
doctorate. By then also our mother had established herself as a tailor in her
own right and was finding work. It became possible for me to branch out during
my graduate research years. I explored what UCL could offer in physics, in
mathematics and in philosophy. Often enough I was the only biologist in these
classes. There was no specifically designed course for such an omnivorously
hungry student. I simply made it up as I went along, and somehow UCL gave me
the freedom to do that. This led to me being the only biologist in the whole
university to beg for time on a precious early valve computer: one of the
first machines used for seriously challenging mathematics, the Ferranti
Mercury. They were so expensive that I doubt whether Ferranti ever made more
than a dozen or so of those machines worldwide. I was given the worst time
slot each day: 2–4 a.m.! Somehow, in between doing experiments on the heart
during the day to obtain the data, I used the evenings and early mornings to
develop the mathematical skills to do computer modelling in biology. This
experience played havoc with my circadian rhythms and looking back on it I
don't know how it was possible to do that for days on end before crashing out
for a long weekend sleep.5

Every part of this brief autobiographical sketch has played a role in the
development of the idea of Biological Relativity, starting with the
mathematics.

### Ultimate Reductionism: Mathematics?6

In spite of the privations, I was happy. I was doing what my professors had
taught me, which was that the destiny of biology was to be reduced
successfully to chemistry, physics and mathematics. Science was seen as a one-
way hierarchy. Each was to be explained in terms of the discipline below it,
with mathematics being the supreme goal of this reduction. I was also
following the challenge of the great nineteenth-century physiologist Claude
Bernard, who as early as 1865 had written ‘[The] application of mathematics to
natural phenomena is the aim of all science, because the expression of the
laws of phenomena should always be mathematical.’

As long rolls of computer-generated tapes of results emerged from the Ferranti
Mercury, I converted them into beautiful graphs displaying the possible
mechanism of heart rhythm. Those graphs found their way into the pages of
articles in Nature as I experienced directly the excitement of what I believed
to be reductionist science. By moving all the way to mathematical analysis, I
thought I had become even more reductionist than my teachers! I even started
to write on determinism for a student journal at UCL. One of my professors
liked the first article so much that he encouraged me to pursue a second one.
I had to disappoint him. It never appeared. My thesis research, though, was
going very well and was soon to result in two Nature publications even before
submitting the thesis.

But what was happening was not at all what I imagined it to be. An experience
that was aimed to be the ultimate form of reduction had a completely contrary
twist in its tail. It was moving me, initially imperceptibly, in precisely the
opposite direction. I don't go along much with the idea of eureka (‘I've got
it!’) moments. Switches from one paradigm to another happen more as a
consequence of an accumulation of many insights coming together rather than as
a single Pauline conversion. But I can point to two key experiences as a
research student that paved the way forward (Figure 6.1).

Figure 6.1

The Hodgkin Cycle. Protein channels generate ion movements which determine the
voltage of the cell. The voltage in turn controls the opening and closing of
the protein channels, and therefore forms part of a feedback system, a form of
circular causality. Reproduced with permission.

The first was the realisation that the Hodgkin Cycle which I was using in
modelling cardiac cells, just as Alan Hodgkin first did with Andrew Huxley for
nerve cells, was an example of circular causality, which necessarily involves
downward causation from the level of the whole cell to influence the behaviour
of its molecules, just as much as upward causation from the molecular level.
The more I thought about that the more I realised that, of course, such multi-
scale interactions occur everywhere in biology. All physiological functions
depend on such circularity. Again, Claude Bernard had led the way with his
concept of control of the internal environment in living organisms. This was
exhilarating but also rather disturbing. Remember that this period was also
witnessing the heyday of molecular biology, with strongly reductionist
concepts of genetic programmes and the Central Dogma dominating biological
thought. There were also the early signs of intimidation. Those working on a
systems approach were openly denigrated as not doing ‘real science’, not being
‘where it is at’. Later, in the 1970s when I became a member of research grant
committees, I was to hear that phrase often. Being ‘where it is at’ was
committee-speak for excluding any other approach. Sadly that exclusion was so
successful that very little integrative research remained. Molecular biology
and genomics sucked up most of the funding.

### Introduction to Spinoza

The second experience arose in a somewhat embarrassing way. I was attending
the graduate seminars in philosophy run by the Grote Professor, Stuart
Hampshire. I am not sure whether he ever knew that I was a gate-crasher, not
really one of his own students. If he did know, he was certainly making no
concessions to the only non-philosopher in his class. At the end of one of the
seminars he singled me out to introduce the next seminar. Each of the students
was expected to do this in turn. In a panic, and with just a week to do it, I
had to choose a topic and write a ten-minute plausible introduction. There was
no time to plough through dense philosophical texts in the library. Anyway,
there were experiments to perform during the day and there was my assignment
with Mercury at night. I had to do what we call winging it, flying by the seat
of one's pants. I raided my premature scribblings on determinism to see what I
could come up with. I decided to give an account of freewill from a
physiologist's perspective by distinguishing causes internal to the organism
from causes external to it. The idea was that only the former could be the
basis of free action.

If you have absorbed the central message of this book, you will already see
the naivety in this approach. It is in the interactions between the two that
we should be looking for clues. But I did not see it that way then.
Hampshire's response showed that he wasn't buying it: ‘Very interesting, Mr
Noble.’ Well, at least he knew my name even if it wasn't on his student list!
I have also become wary of professional philosophers who begin their comments
with ‘very interesting’, a sure sign that something is wrong. He continued:
‘Mr Noble, you should read Spinoza.’ That was it. End of story. The rest of
the seminar has become a haze in my memory as the class dissected the paper
and pulled it to pieces. All I can now recall is finding myself at the local
bookshop to buy Hampshire's excellent book, Spinoza,7 and an edition of the
collected works and letters of Spinoza. I still have both of them. Hampshire's
book was beautifully clear. The collected works were dense and seemed
incomprehensible. But I now know that I was looking in the wrong place. I
should have focused on the letters at the end of the book. I didn't read those
until 40 years later.

### Spinoza's Way Out of the Cartesian Paradigm

In Western scientific thought the mechanistic reductionist view can be seen to
have originated with Descartes in the seventeenth century, while relying
heavily on Newtonian mechanics later in the century, and in later centuries on
the mathematical genius of Pierre-Simon Laplace. The philosopher René
Descartes laid the foundation by arguing that animals could be regarded as
machines in some way comparable to the ingenious hydrostatic robots that had
become popular amongst the aristocracy in their gardens. Newtonian mechanics
cemented the foundation with the laws of mechanical motion, and Laplace
systematised the ideas with his famous statement that a supreme intelligence
could use mathematics to predict the future completely, and retrodict the past
as well. Everything that has or will happen would be clear to such a being.

Descartes even foresaw one of the central ideas of Neo-Darwinism:

If one had a proper knowledge of all the parts of the semen of some species of
animal in particular, for example of man, one might be able to deduce the
whole form and configuration of each of its members from this alone, by means
of entirely mathematical and certain arguments, the complete figure and the
conformation of its members.8

This is essentially the idea that there is a complete mathematical ‘programme’
there in the semen, prefiguring Jacob and Monod's ‘genetic programme’.
Complete because he writes ‘from this alone’.9

It is therefore very significant that the earliest traces of the concept of
Biological Relativity can be traced back to Descartes’ main philosophical
opponent. In 1665, just two years after the foundation of the Royal Society,
Benedict de Spinoza, working in Holland, was in extensive correspondence with
the first Secretary of that Society, Henry Oldenburg, working in London
(Figure 6.2).

![](../Images/17624fig6_2.png)

Figure 6.2

Part of Spinoza's letter to the Royal Society Secretary, 1665. The Latin text
of the section translated into English here begins ‘concipiamus jam, si
placet…’ (‘Let us imagine, with your permission…’).

Oldenburg had just returned from meeting Spinoza in Holland and had been
fascinated by his discussions with him on ‘the principles of the Cartesian and
Baconian philosophies’. Spinoza was opposed to the dualism of mind and body
espoused by Descartes. This was necessary in Descartes’ view of animals as
automata since he wished to exclude humans from this view and so attributed
their freewill to a separate substance, the soul, which could interact with
the body. Spinoza was in the process of seeking to publish his great work (The
ethics: Ethica ordine geometrico demonstrata) in which he proposes an
alternative philosophy. The correspondence shows how close the Philosophical
Transactions of the Royal Society came to being the vehicle for one of his
seminal publications. In the end, however, Spinoza did not publish in
Philosophical Transactions, but this correspondence includes an important
letter from Spinoza which could form a text for the systems approach and for
one of the bases for the concept of Biological Relativity. The original letter
in Latin is still kept in the Royal Society library. He writes: ‘every part of
nature agrees with the whole, and is associated with all other parts’ and ‘by
the association of parts, then, I merely mean that the laws or nature of one
part adapt themselves to the laws or nature of another part, so as to cause
the least possible inconsistency’. He realised therefore some of the problems
faced in trying to understand what, today, we would characterise as an open
system.

In particular, he appreciated the difficulty in working from knowledge of
minute components to an understanding of the whole:

Let us imagine, with your permission, a little worm, living in the blood, able
to distinguish by sight the particles of blood, lymph etc, and to reflect on
the manner in which each particle, on meeting with another particle, either is
repulsed, or communicates a portion of its own motion. This little worm would
live in the blood, in the same way as we live in a part of the universe, and
would consider each particle of blood, not as a part, but as a whole. He would
be unable to determine, how all the parts are modified by the general nature
of blood, and are compelled by it to adapt themselves, so as to stand in a
fixed relation to one another.

This paragraph could stand even today as a succinct statement of one of the
main ideas of Biological Relativity. He doesn't use a mathematical medium to
express his idea, but this could be so expressed as the aim to understand how
the initial and boundary conditions of a system constrain the parts to produce
a particular solution to the differential equations describing their motions.
We need, then, to move to the complete system (with whatever boundary we
choose to use to define that) in order even to understand the parts.

In this chapter I will express Spinoza's main concept in modern terms. We will
see that Spinoza's idea is a necessary but not a sufficient condition to
complete the escape from Cartesian determinism. There are two further
conditions that need to be satisfied to arrive at the theory of Biological
Relativity. These conditions will be described later (see Why Spinoza's
Constraint is Not Sufficient).

### The Essence of Biological Relativity

To get an immediate practical experience of the main idea, take some knitting
needles and some wool. Knit a rectangle. If you don't knit, just imagine the
rectangle. Or use an old knitted scarf, preferably a loose knit so that you
can see how the individual knots behave. Now pull on one corner of the
rectangle while keeping the opposite corner fixed. What happens? The whole
network of knitted knots moves. Now reverse the corners and pull on the other
corner. Again the whole network moves, though in a different way. This is a
property of networks. Everything ultimately connects to everything else. Any
part of the network can be the prime mover, and be the cause of the rest of
the network moving and adjusting to the tension. Actually, in living systems,
it would be better still to drop the idea of any specific element as a prime
mover. It is networks that are dynamically functional.

Now knit a three-dimensional network. Again, imagine it. You probably don't
actually know how to knit such a thing. Pulling on any part of the three-
dimensional structure will cause all other parts to move. It doesn't matter
whether you pull on the bottom, the top or the sides. All can be regarded as
equivalent. There is no privileged location within the network.

The three-dimensional network recalls Waddington's epigenetic landscape
network (Figure 6.3) and is quite a good analogy to biological networks since
the third dimension can be viewed as representing the multi-scale nature of
biological networks. Properties at the scales of cells, tissues and organs
influence activities of elements, such as genes and proteins, at the lower
scales. This is sometimes called downward causation, to distinguish it from
the reductionist interpretation of causation as upward causation.11 This is
the mechanism of the constraints in Spinoza's text quoted above.

![](../Images/17624fig6_3.png)

Figure 6.3

Conrad Waddington's diagram of the epigenetic landscape from The Strategy of
the Genes. Genes (solid pegs at the bottom) are viewed as parts of complex
networks so that many gene products interact between themselves and with the
phenotype to produce the phenotypic landscape (top) through which development
occurs. Waddington's insight was that new forms could arise through new
combinations to produce new landscapes in response to environmental pressure,
and that these could then be assimilated into the genome (image from
Waddington 1957).10

‘Down’ and ‘up’ here are metaphors and should be treated carefully. The
essential point is the more neutral statement: there is no privileged level of
causality. This must be the case in organisms which work through many forms of
circular causality. One of the consequences of the relativistic view is that
genesM (see [Chapter 5](book-part5.html#CT-bp-5) for the different definitions
of a gene) cease to be represented as active causes.12 Templates are passive
causes, used when needed. Active causation resides in the networks which
include many components for which there are no DNA templates. So, genesJ do
not behave like genesM since they also include network properties. It is the
physics and chemistry of those dynamic networks that enable them to function,
but just as the properties of molecules emerge from the interactions between
the component atoms, so the dynamic networks emerge from the interactions of
the individual molecules and structural components. The individual components
are constrained by being parts of the network (Figure 6.4).

![](../Images/17624fig6_4.png)

Figure 6.4

Many models of biological systems consist of differential equations for the
kinetics of each component. These equations cannot give a solution (the
output) without setting the initial conditions (the state of the components at
the time at which the simulation begins) and the boundary conditions. The
boundary conditions define what constraints are imposed on the system by its
environment and can therefore be considered as a form of contextual causation
from a higher scale. The arrows are not really unidirectional. The dotted
arrows complete the diagram to show that the output contributes to the
boundary conditions (although not uniquely), and they determine the initial
conditions for the next integration step (legend and diagram from Noble,
2012).13

An important linguistic feature of the alternative, relativistic, concepts
proposed here is that most or all the anthropomorphic features of the Neo-
Darwinist language can be eliminated, without contravening a single biological
experimental fact. There may be other forms of representation that can achieve
the same result. It doesn't really matter which you use. The aim is simply to
distance ourselves from the biased conceptual scheme that Neo-Darwinism has
brought to biology, made more problematic by the fact that it has been
presented as literal truth.

### Conceptual and Empirical Interpretations

The principle that there is no privileged scale of causality can easily be
misinterpreted. It is important now to introduce some clarifications.

First, we must distinguish between its conceptual status and its practical
implications. It is an a-priori statement, i.e. a statement about what we
should or should not assume in advance of doing the experiments. We should not
assume that causation necessarily resides at a particular, e.g. molecular,
scale. That is the mistake made by naive reductionism in biology. The
reduction to molecular-level events is treated as a methodological necessity,
whereas it should emerge, if at all, from the experiments themselves. Before
we do those experiments, we can't know which parts of a system are involved in
its behaviour, nor attribute any privileged position to them.

But that does not mean that all scales must be involved in any given example.
The circles of causal networks may span particular ranges of scales, which may
be more or less limited in extent. And there may be particular levels that act
as important hubs. Those facts are for us to discover as empirical
observations. For example, many biologists, me included, believe that the cell
is a central level of integration in much of biology. That conviction is a
result of extensive experiments on cells showing their functional integrity
and that many physiological functions cannot be ascribed to entities lower
than the cell. Cells contain the main metabolic networks, circadian and
various other rhythm networks, cell cycle networks and so on.

The important position of the cell is not surprising since for billions of
years all organisms were unicellular. And even in multicellular organisms like
you and me, the cell is the level at which we pass on most inherited
characteristics. There is a bottleneck in the reproductive process. Eggs and
sperm are single cells, and so is their union before embryonic development.
All organisms that reproduce sexually necessarily go through a single-cell
stage in their life cycles.

The genome also has a unique position. But it is not the one most often
ascribed to it as a programme dictating life. As the American cell biochemist
Franklin Harold puts it in his book In Search of Cell History, ‘The genome is
not the cell's command center but a highly privileged databank, something like
a recipe or a musical score, yet for the purpose of parsing evolution, genes
have a rightful claim to center stage.’ Parsing is the analysis of strings of
symbols, usually with guidance from some rules of grammar. In the case of DNA,
the start and stop sequences and those for binding transcription factors,
amongst other features, provide those guidelines. Analysis of this kind has
indeed been exceptionally useful in the inter-species DNA sequence comparisons
that now form the basis of much of our understanding of evolutionary history.
This is the method by which Carl Woese's discovery of the archaea was
confirmed (see [Chapter 4](book-part4.html#CT-bp-4)).

Each feature of organisms at the various levels may have unique properties.
The principle of Biological Relativity should not be taken to require that all
forms of causation involved are equivalent. We will meet the different forms
of causation later in this chapter.

With regard to possible boundaries of multi-scale interactions, it is unlikely
that scales below that of atoms will be relevant in physiological processes
except in the general sense of having the properties that make life possible.
For similar reasons, scales above that of the planet are unlikely to be more
involved than making life possible.

But, as we have seen, there are many scales between these two extremes.
Moreover, it is now known as a matter of fact that interactions between all of
the scales involved in organisms and their environment occur. As Spinoza
foresaw, the smallest particles, which for us are the molecules of living
organisms, are constrained by their cellular environment, which in turn are
constrained in multicellular organisms by the physiological properties of
tissues, organs and systems, while whole organisms are constrained by their
environment, including interactions with other organisms, which means that
sociological factors also matter.

If, like Spinoza's imagined little worm, we focus on observing the motions of
those smallest particles, we will find that they do indeed obey the laws of
physics and chemistry in their interactions with other molecules. In that
sense, and in that sense alone, biology can in principle be reduced to physics
and chemistry. It is when we focus on more global, but nonetheless real,
properties that we can see the limits of that reduction. Even constraining
some gas molecules by putting them in a container constrains their motions so
that there will be an overall property, the pressure of the gas, within the
container. In any equations we use to describe what is happening, that
constraint will appear in the boundary conditions that must be inserted into
our model to enable a solution to be found. This fact is universal. All
models, even entirely determinate ones, require initial and boundary
conditions to be inserted into the equations before we can make any
predictions on what may happen.

### Open and Closed Systems

Initial and boundary conditions will be required even if we isolate the
container from any other influences beyond its boundaries. That is what we
call a closed system. A closed system, however, is an idealisation for
experimental purposes. Real systems are never strictly isolated. Even a
container would need to be completely rigid (which is an idealisation) to be
strictly isolated. In practice, the container material itself will be subject
to the pressures on it, within and without. That is very obvious indeed if the
container is a balloon, which will readily expand if we put more gas inside it
as the balloon material is elastic. Even the most rigid material, however, has
some degree of elasticity. In physical experiments we simply reduce that
elasticity to the point at which such variations are negligible. Physicists
have to go to extraordinary lengths to achieve isolation of their experiments
from outside influences.

But we cannot possibly do that with living systems. Organisms are necessarily
open systems. They must exchange energy and matter with their environment in
order to survive. They are, therefore, active systems and they manage this
interaction with the environment according to the control processes that exist
within them. The constraints on behaviour can then take many different forms,
depending on how those exchanges occur and what controls them.

Of course, it is possible to perform experiments on organisms and their
components that aim at the idealisation of a closed system. But it is then
important to understand that we will no longer be experimenting on a living
organism. It will be dead. Many biological experiments nevertheless involve
such procedures. Experiments done particularly to determine the structure of
the molecules of living organisms are performed in this way. DNA was not part
of a living organism when its double helical structure was worked out by
Watson, Crick, Wilkins and Franklin.14 There really is nothing alive in the
DNA molecule alone. If I could completely isolate a whole genome, put it in a
petri dish with as many nutrients as we may wish, I could keep it for 10,000
years and it would do absolutely nothing other than to slowly degrade.

Physiological investigations to determine function and to reveal control
mechanisms must, however, also involve living systems. There is then no escape
from the constraint that they are open systems.

### Why Spinoza's Constraint is not Sufficient

So far in this chapter I have expressed Spinoza's idea of the constraint of
parts by the whole in terms of the constraint by a larger scale. What would
happen if we extend out to the largest scale of all, the universe? His answer
would be that we then arrive back at a completely deterministic system. This
is Nature as a whole, which for Spinoza was the prime mover, or God, Deus sive
Natura (God or Nature).

Two further conditions are required to complete the theory of Biological
Relativity and to escape fully from the Cartesian paradigm. The first is
stochasticity. The second is the distinction between scales and levels.

Stochasticity. The idea that the genetic material is read in a fully
determinate way was originally proposed by Schrödinger in 1943.15 But it was
also implied by Descartes (see quotation earlier in this chapter) and by
Weismann's Barrier idea. These authors did not know about DNA, but they
assumed that whatever was the genetic material was the sole determinant of the
organism's structure and development. This idea is a mistake and its
correction is essential to the theory of Biological Relativity.

It is true, of course, that at the micro level there is a determinate read-out
in the sense that the DNA sequence uniquely determines the protein amino acid
sequence, as described in [Chapter 5](book-part5.html#CT-bp-5) ([Figure
5.2](book-part5.html#FIG-fig-32)). But this is not sufficient to specify the
phenotype. That also depends on the pattern formed by the relative quantities
of the different proteins expressed. That pattern is not specified by the DNA
sequence. It is specified by the cells, tissues and organs of the body through
the control they exert on the expression levels of different proteins. Those
levels are also strongly stochastic. This fact was first observed in
biochemical components of organisms by R.J. Williams in 1956,18 and it has
been beautifully confirmed by recent experiments revealing the extent of
stochasticity in gene expression. Neighbouring cells in a population can
differ in the level of expression by as much as three orders of magnitude
(Figure 6.5).

![](../Images/17624fig6_5.png)

Figure 6.5

Variation in expression levels of a protein16 in cells within a cultured
population. The top image shows the numbers of cells displaying various levels
of expression. The range, indicated by the horizontal bar, is 1000-fold, i.e.
three orders of magnitude. The lower image shows the resolution of the method
by which the levels were measured, which is clearly well within the accuracy
required (from Chang et al. 2008 17).

This extensive variation leaves it wide open to an organism to select what
works in any given situation. In fact, the same experiments that produced the
result in Figure 6.5 also showed that the distribution curve is a property of
the population as a whole, not of single cells. In the sense used in this
book, that distribution is an attractor created by the population.

Levels and emergent properties. The difference between scales and levels was
introduced in [Chapter 2](book-part2.html#CT-bp-2). Scale is a matter only of
extension, i.e. how large a part of nature is considered. Level is a matter of
organisation, which could be a cell, an organ, an organism, a population and
so on. In the context of the theory of Biological Relativity, the difference
is crucial. A level is a functional entity with goals and natural ability to
achieve those goals. The level of a cell, for example, exists because cells
are integrated functional entities with properties that emerge as the
interactions of their component parts within the constraints exerted by the
cell as a whole. We encountered some of those emergent properties in [Chapter
3](book-part3.html#CT-bp-3), including circadian and cardiac rhythms. These
emergent properties not only characterise what a cell is, they also constrain
(in Spinoza's sense) the component, e.g. molecular, parts to conform to the
goals of the cell. It is through these meaningful constraints that the
behaviour of the whole can be said to display natural purposiveness.

The theory of Biological Relativity requires all three of these necessary
conditions: constraint of components by the whole, stochasticity and emergent
goal-directed properties. Together they satisfy the requirements for
conditioned arising,19 the processes by which each development creates the
conditions for further development, with stochasticity guaranteeing that the
processes cannot be completely determinate.20

### Forms of Causation

The requirement for initial and boundary conditions to solve the equations for
any system already introduces us to two different forms of causation. The laws
of motion represented by differential equations will be one form which is
dynamic, while the conditions will be another form which is more like a formal
cause. Once we introduce control processes and the activity of organisms which
those processes enable, there will be even more forms to take into account.
Philosophers have been familiar with the need to consider different forms of
causation ever since Aristotle outlined his four forms over 2000 years ago.21
Those four forms are still relevant, though they need updating to take account
of the kinds of causal interactions that we now know about.

Material cause. This refers to the nature of the material of which something
is made. A table, for example, will behave differently dependent on whether it
is made from wood, metal, glass, stone, etc. Some materials can burn easily,
bend easily, transmit light easily, others cannot. We can update this to
include everything we know about the physico-chemical composition of the
materials in living systems. It is in this sense that we can say that even the
subatomic scale is relevant. It is relevant to what makes it possible for the
materials to exist and have the properties they have. Clearly this is a
passive cause in the context of understanding biology. In relation to living
organisms the material structure of the universe is a cause in this sense.

Formal cause. This refers to the way in which the material is arranged. The
same material arranged as a chair will serve a different purpose and be
responsible for different things to happen than when the same material is
arranged as a table. Today, we would have difficulty drawing the same
distinction between the first two Aristotelian forms. The same atoms can be
arranged differently to produce materials with very different properties.
Notably, carbon atoms can be arranged to produce soft graphite, or to produce
super-hard diamond. Aristotle, of course, would not have known about atoms, or
our subatomic particles. We can make a pencil out of graphite, but not out of
a diamond, which would be used for very different purposes for which a pencil
would be useless. The distinction between material and formal cause therefore
depends on the scale at which we are working. A difference in formal cause at
one scale can become a material cause at a higher scale. Formal causes are
very important in biological systems since their organisation is what makes
life possible. This is the correct category for genes. The DNA sequences are a
form of structure, an arrangement of the DNA molecule, a kind of molecular
anatomy.

Efficient cause. This is the active form of causation central to reductionist
accounts of living systems, and it refers to what acts to produce dynamic
effects, for example one billiard ball hitting another to send it off with new
direction and velocity. The mistake in the reductionist account is to assume
that there is necessarily and always a prime mover. We need therefore to add
the principle of relativity since it is necessary to recognise that in many
systems of interactions involving circular causality there will be no ‘prime
mover’. In the Hodgkin Cycle, for example, it doesn't make much sense to ask
whether the protein channels or the cell voltage form the prime mover since
they depend on and move each other. This is evident also in the differential
equations we use in Hodgkin–Huxley type models. In each time step of the
integration both limbs of the cycle are computed together. This will be true
in all forms of circular causality. This is where Biological Relativity has
one of its most important consequences. Looking for a ‘prime mover’ is the
wrong strategy when we should be focusing on interactions in processes.

Final cause. This is what the action is used for in the sense of its function
and its purpose. The heart is for the pumping of blood; the lungs are for the
exchange of respiratory gases, oxygen and carbon dioxide; eggs and sperm are
for the reproduction of the species; and so on. This is the form of causation
that gives pure reductionists most concern and why they usually wish to
eliminate it from biological theory. They would argue that teleological cause
can always be replaced by explanations in terms of efficient (mechanical)
cause. But that approach privileges the level at which causation is thought to
occur, usually represented as molecular. There is no reason to make that
assumption and in open systems it must be wrong to do so. Functional
significance, purpose and therefore teleological causation arise as inter-
scale interactions in which the components at the lower scale are constrained
in a functional way by the properties at a higher scale. This is the essential
point that was understood by Spinoza, as we saw earlier in this chapter.

As we have also seen in this chapter, expressed rigorously in mathematical
terms there is nothing mysterious about such constraints. All open systems are
subject to them. The causation involved is just as effective as any other
form. Scientifically testable theories should therefore incorporate such
causation. The problem for some scientists has perhaps arisen from the word
‘final’. From a mechanistic viewpoint, such causation is of course relative.
The word ‘final’ does not entail that there is some overall purpose, an
intelligent designer or other theological assumptions. It simply means
‘purpose’. Those purposes arise from the inter-scale interactions. Processes
at higher scales give purpose to processes at lower scales. This is a central
feature of the concept of the relativity of epistemology, which will be
explored in [Chapter 9](book-part9.html#CT-bp-9).

Consider as a concrete example the regularity of the normal heartbeat and how
it is disturbed in life-threatening arrhythmias which I described in [Chapter
3](book-part3.html#CT-bp-3). The normal heartbeat is an attractor caused by a
circular form of causality in which both the cell potential and the individual
proteins are entrained by their interaction. Once the rhythm begins it can
continue indefinitely. Even large perturbations in the individual proteins or
their genes can be resisted. Now consider what happens when a different kind
of attractor is established. This happens in the heart when abnormal spiral
waves of excitation arise at the level of the whole heart. The individual
molecules in each cell are now constrained to dance to a different and much
more chaotic rhythm. Viewed from the level of the individual molecules, both
of these influences from the higher levels of the cell or the whole organ will
seem inexplicable, even apparently random. The molecules are like boats tossed
around in a storm beyond their own control. Yet, the storm also depends on
their activity. Indeed, it can be modelled using the equations for that
activity. Each of the three views – the molecular, the cellular and the organ
– are valid, but only the higher levels provide an explanation of what is
happening.

Using this example, we can also clarify the distinction between function and
purpose. The function of the protein--membrane network that ensures cardiac
rhythm is clear at the level of cells, but does not even exist at the level of
molecules. Its purpose, though, becomes clear at an even higher level, i.e.
the cardiovascular system. A single cell ‘knows’ nothing about that purpose.
The distinction between function and purpose can therefore be a matter of the
level at which each is relevant.22

Beyond the Aristotelian forms. While it is historically necessary to recognise
the insights of Aristotle since his classification of the forms of causation
is still very relevant today, it is also important to note that developments
in modern science have introduced variations on his theme that he could not
have anticipated.

Attractors. The concept of an attractor is a good example. If the functional
process expresses itself as an attractor it literally pulls the system towards
a goal. Within what is called the basin of the attractor, the components have
to go along with it.23 That is another way of expressing the influence of a
higher scale on the behaviour of components at a lower scale. We met examples
of these in the cases of heart rhythm and circadian rhythm in [Chapter
3](book-part3.html#CT-bp-3). On astronomical scales a black hole acts as an
attractor, as does a spiral galaxy.

Coding. The concept of coding also introduces a form of causation that is new,
even though it can be represented within Aristotle's classification. Within
his system, coding can be seen as a formal cause since it concerns the way in
which components are arranged. But I don't think that his idea of formal cause
captures the full weight of the concept of coding in molecular biology. There
is something special about the discovery of the triplet code for the way in
which nucleic acid sequences act as templates for amino acids in protein
sequences. Equally, however, we should not endow molecular biological coding
with implications beyond what the molecular biological facts show. This is
where the concept of coding has been misinterpreted. Molecular biological
coding does not have the same meaning as coding in the sense of intentional
human communication. That sense of coding occurs in a context in which the
messages encoded have meaning. There is no meaning in the nucleic acid
sequences themselves. Meaning arises as a consequence of the contextual logic
within which they are interpreted within a living organism. On their own, the
sequences have no more significance than the bar codes of products. If all
that we knew about organisms was restricted to knowledge of their DNA
sequences, we would have to guess what they might correspond to. Talking about
the ‘genetic code’ is also an example of hidden teleology by giving DNA
sequences a significance in meaning that they don't have as an intrinsic
property.

Reasons. In [Chapter 9](book-part9.html#CT-bp-9) I will explain the role of
reasons and contextual logic in causation by the environmental context in
which an organism functions. Here, I will simply note its existence.

There are therefore multiple categories of causation. In any particular
biological function there may also be many separate causes in each category.
Complex biological functions have correspondingly complex causal logic. Be
wary therefore when someone tells you that a particular fraction of a function
or disease is due to a particular cause, such as gene mutations or the
environment. The fractions of causation are dependent on each other. If any
cause is a necessary cause, the fractions of causation by all the others will
fall to zero if that cause is absent. It is a common mistake in reductionist
accounts to attribute particular percentages to genetic and environmental
factors.24 When the processes depend on the interactions between different
causes and their consequences, the outcome will not be a simple linear sum of
the correlations; it will be difficult to predict and can even be
counterintuitive.

### Conclusions

In this chapter we have seen that the principle of Biological Relativity is
best stated as the theory that all levels in organisms have causal efficacy.
There is no privileged level from which all the others may be derived. The
principle does not, however, mean that all levels are equivalent. The nature
of the causal influence of each level on the others may differ.

The principle is a necessary step in understanding living organisms since they
are multi-level, open stochastic systems in which the behaviour at any level
depends on causal interaction between higher and lower levels and cannot be
understood in isolation. That is true even of unicellular organisms and it is
even more so of multicellular forms of life, including ourselves as humans.

In this chapter we have seen that incorporation of this principle is necessary
even for reductionist explanations to work. The reason is that although the
mechanisms by which the components of a system operate might be described by
determinate mechanisms, the constraints will appear in the initial and
boundary conditions needed to solve the equations for the behaviour of the
whole system. Even a nineteenth-century determinist following the ideas of
Laplace would have to acknowledge that fact. It is represented in the
equations of calculus developed by Newton, Leibniz and Laplace.

When we add the roles of stochasticity and the emergent forms of natural
purposiveness at different levels of organisation we arrive at the full
principle of Biological Relativity.

The principle can be seen to change fundamentally our view of living
organisms. The consequences for biological explanation and for theories of
evolution will be explored in the next two chapters.

Those consequences are to be found at all levels in organisms. Although in
this book I often focus on the need to revise the gene-centric view to take
account of causation at all levels, the same point applies at all levels.
Organs are subject to the whole-body systems; tissues and cells are subject to
the organs of which they are parts; molecules are subject to all the higher
levels. And all of these are subject to the sociology of interactions of
organisms with each other and with different species. That is what life is
about.

3 Some critics of my recent work towards writing this book have even
challenged my right to do so. To quote one of them: ‘Has Noble ever produced a
single valid criticism of modern evolutionary theory?’ I have been doing so
for over 40 years. I organised the first debate in Oxford on The Selfish Gene
when it appeared in 1976. At the International Congress of Physiological
Sciences I co-edited the 1993 The Logic of Life (Oxford University Press,
Oxford) and co-authored a chapter entitled ‘The challenge of integrative
physiology’. The Nobel laureate Sir James Black and the evolutionary biologist
Stephen J. Gould also made important contributions to that book. Many of the
ideas of the present book were first outlined a decade ago in Noble, D. (2006)
The Music of Life (Oxford University Press, Oxford). Since then I have
published over 20 substantial peer-reviewed papers on the subject. These are
listed in the notes to the Preface of this book and they contain many
criticisms of the dogmatic forms of Neo-Darwinism. My main original
contribution to the field is to have shown mathematically how strong forms of
genetic buffering occur. Models of the cardiac pacemaker can be used in
reverse-engineering mode and they reveal how misleading knockout experiments
can be in relating genomes to phenotypes. Noble, D., J.C. Denyer, H.F. Brown
and D. DiFrancesco (1992) Reciprocal role of the inward currents ib, Na and if

cells. Proceedings of the Royal Society B 250:199–207; Noble, D. (2011)

which most studies of gene function have been performed and therefore to the
very basis of gene-centred theories of biology.

4 People still spoke in awe of Bayliss and Starling who had discovered the
first hormone, secretin. A.V. Hill (Nobel laureate 1922) was still working in
the Physiology Department while I was a student. Henry Dale (Nobel laureate
with Otto Loewi in 1936) was sometimes to be seen. Bernard Katz was doing the
work that gained him the Nobel Prize in 1970. Peter Medawar was doing what
gained him the same accolade in 1960. James Black, who later became Head of
Pharmacology, was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1988. Hugh Huxley was doing his
pioneering work on muscle contraction. Andrew Huxley arrived as Head of
Department in 1960 and received the Nobel Prize in 1963. It is easy to see why
I hesitated about moving to Oxford in 1963.

6 The reader should understand that I am not proposing that mathematics, in
itself, is reductionist. In the beginning of this chapter I am describing what
I thought (incorrectly!) as a student in the 1960s. As the story develops it
becomes clear that mathematics was actually my way out of the reductionist
mind-set. Mathematical thinking has a very strong history of addressing
complexity and emergence. See, for example, the special issue of Progress in
Biophysics and Molecular Biology devoted to the topic of Biomathics (volume
119, 2015).

12 The different forms of causation are classified and dealt with later in
this chapter. By active causation I mean efficient cause. The difference
between passive and active causation is rather like the difference between
anatomy and physiology. Anatomical structure is what permits a function to be
performed, which is a formal cause. Physiological processes are what makes it
happen. Molecular sequences in nucleic acids and proteins are forms of
molecular anatomy.

13 This diagram is highly simplified to represent what we actually solve
mathematically. In reality, boundary conditions are also involved in
determining initial conditions and the output parameters can also influence
the boundary conditions, while they in turn are also the initial conditions
for a further period of integration of the equations. There are also important
differences between ordinary differential equation models and partial
differential equation models. The boundary conditions in partial differential
equations become incorporated into the parameters in equivalent ordinary
differential equation models. Noble, D. (2012) A theory of biological

19 The term ‘conditioned arising’ refers to processes that happen in
dependence on multiple causes that, to use the language I favour, form the
initial and boundary conditions for each stage of the process. Together with
stochasticity in the nature of those causes and the problem of combinatorial
explosion in multiple causation, such processes can easily become unique in
each instantiation. Re-running the process would not necessarily give the same
result unless there is a powerful attractor that makes the final result
relatively independent of the initial causes.

20 An important theoretical question is whether this stochasticity is real or
apparent, particularly since it is possible to show that determinate input to
mathematical formulae called delayed differential equations can produce
stochastic results: Lei, J. and M.C. Mackey (2011) Deterministic Brownian
motion generated from differential delay equations. Physical Review E
84:041105. At the levels of cells, tissues and organisms, I doubt whether this
matters.

22 There sometimes seems to be an irreducible fuzziness to the
function–purpose distinction. Both are emergent. But the richness of the
emergent behaviour is so different at the different levels that it is possible
to draw a line between them, at least in some well worked out cases. The
example of cardiac rhythm that I give here in the main text is useful because
the function (rhythm) and purpose (to pump blood) emerge at clearly different
levels of organisation. ‘Function’ and ‘purpose’ are used a lot in physiology.
Is this a matter of explanation or of utility, or perhaps both? In a very well
thought-through article on the concept of function in modern physiology,
Etienne Roux concludes: ‘the main interest of functional analysis does not
reside in its explanatory but in its heuristic value, opposing the poverty of
functionalism as an explicative doctrine to its fruitfulness as a programme
for research (Hempel, 1965). In this view, postulating the teleological
dimension of the system under investigation is fruitful because it legitimates
a reverse engineering-based methodology of research.’ Roux, Etienne (2014) The
concept of function in modern physiology. Journal of Physiology 592:2245–2249.
I agree, and the examples from work on the heart that I give in this book
illustrate that perfectly. Without reverse engineering, the identification of
ivabradine as a useful medication would have been much harder (see [Chapter
8](book-part8.html#CT-bp-8) for this example).

23 There is a whole field of mathematics concerned with attractors. There is a
useful introduction on Wikipedia: <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attractor>.

24 Remember the equations DNA = 0; environment = 0; DNA + environment = 100%.
These express the fact that DNA alone does nothing to produce life. So does
the environment in the absence of DNA. The two together ensure that there is
life. You might think that scientists are the last people to be confused about
the logic of causation. Sadly, that is not the case. Consider a recent article
on the causation of cancer published in the prestigious journal Science:
Tomasetti, C. and B. Vogelstein (2014) Variation in cancer risk among tissues
can be explained by the number of cell divisions. Science 347:78–81. The
authors’ experimental observations are fascinating. They show a strong
correlation between cell division rate and chances of cancer development,
which is already well-known. But they conclude ‘These results suggest that
only a third of the variation in cancer risk among tissues is attributable to
environmental factors or inherited predispositions.’ This is strange since we
know, for example, that smoking is a major cause of cancer, with over 80%
correlation; much more than one-third in the case of lung cancer. The problem
is solved once one realises that the relevant logic is: if X and if Y then Z.
In this logic if either X or Y do not occur then Z does not occur. You would
therefore find 100% correlation with either X or Y. But to conclude that the
other contributes 0% would obviously be wrong. The same kind of combinatorial
logic applies when the correlations are less than 100%. In combinatorial
logic, percentages do not add linearly.



## 7 Dancing Nucleotides

Natural Genetic Engineering

The genome is an organ of the cell.

Barbara McClintock, Nobel Prize lecture 1983

### Pipes and Templates

For more than a decade now I have been privileged to learn from and sometimes
even perform with the Swiss virtuoso classical guitarist, Christoph Denoth.
The title of one of my previous books, The Music of Life, was chosen during a
visit to Basel in 2003. Christoph was in the audience for my lecture and I
wanted a metaphor that he would appreciate. Music as a metaphor for the
processes of life emerged when, on the spur of the moment, I compared the
genome to a vast pipe organ. The point is that the pipes do not themselves
play the music. They are passive agents. The organist is the active agent. As
we have learnt in earlier chapters, DNA sequences are also passive. It is the
organism that actively ‘plays’ them.

A few years later, Christoph and I were at the workshop of Paul Fischer, in
the charming Oxfordshire town of Chipping Norton. Paul was making a new guitar
and we were there to assist in choosing the wood. As we tapped the sheets he
brought out from his store of well-seasoned spruce we listened to the
resonance of the pieces that might be used for the all-important soundboard.
This is one of the most critical steps, determining how the finished guitar
will sound. There are people who specialise in finding the Swiss Alpine trees
from which to cut the pieces with the required fine and uniform grain that top
luthiers require.

A few months later the guitar was ready to be played. Given all the care and
attention in the hands of a master craftsman it was not surprising that the
sound was a joy to listen to. All that remained were a few fine adjustments
and the instrument would be ready for concert performances. Except that when
on delivery Christoph played it the sound was muffled, dead. This was very
strange. We had ourselves witnessed the sweetness of the sound and felt the
joy of playing it in the workshop.1

We telephoned Paul, who was equally surprised, until he asked us a question.
Can you feel inside under the soundboard? There was the explanation: a wooden
spacer to hold the struts during construction had accidently been left in
place. On removing it, the sweet sound reappeared. I kept the spacer but the
next time I phoned him to return it he told me the sad news that this was to
be one of the last guitars he would make. He had decided to retire, and he
offered to let me have the template he had used for so many of his guitars. It
is a simple plastic shape to determine the shape of the soundboard. It also
has lines that determine where those wooden struts will be placed in a fan
arrangement (Figure 7.1).

![](../Images/17624fig7_1.png)

Figure 7.1

Paul Fischer guitar (above) and the template used to construct it (bottom).
The lines forming a fan indicate where the struts are placed underneath the
soundboard to influence the resonance of the instrument (courtesy of Paul
Fischer, luthier).

The precise placing of these fan struts (braces) determines the balance
between the resonances of the wood at different frequencies. In a sense,
therefore, the template is a cause of the way in which the instrument plays.
So also is the way in which the guitarist strikes the strings. Even the shape,
length and smoothness of the fingernails are important. But clearly we are
dealing here with different kinds of cause. The template is a passive cause.
Its existence and use were necessary but in no sense can the template be said
to play the music. Just as with the keyboard of a pipe organ, the active cause
of the music that the instrument produces is the act of playing by the
performer. This distinction between active and passive causes is important.

Genome sequences work just like Fischer's template. They are necessary; no
doubt about their importance. As James Watson first suggested, they form a
sequence template that is used to enable protein sequences to be formed.2 They
are for that reason totally necessary for life as we know it to exist since
life on Earth requires proteins. But the DNA sequences do not themselves carry
out the physiological functions served by the active networks of proteins,
metabolites and the three-dimensional cellular and organ structures within
which they work.

It's as simple as that. With that distinction in mind, let's now see how we
can develop a theory of evolution that respects it.

### Summary of the Problem

In [Chapter 5](book-part5.html#CT-bp-5) we found that Neo-Darwinism is
incomplete as a theory of evolution. It also suffers from deep conceptual
confusions, and is not compatible with the wider range of experimental
evidence we now have.

To summarise the conceptual confusions:

First, it is seriously confused about the central entity of the theory, the
gene. Different definitions of a gene and of genetics have incompatible
consequences for the theory since the definition of a gene has shifted all the
way from referring to a necessary cause of a particular phenotype to referring
to a DNA sequence, where the issue of causality is an empirical question.

Second, it is confused about the different forms, natures and direction of
causality, which in turn is why it prefers to avoid or ‘reduce’ the role of
teleology and purpose. This is also why it represents genes (DNA sequences) as
active causes rather than as passive templates. Significantly, the
teleological language (‘selfish’ etc.) has not been eliminated; it has simply
been wrongly attributed to the gene instead of to the organism. Of course it
is true that most active scientists who think in Neo-Darwinist terms would
deny that the anthropomorphic language is intended; they would say it is
simply a way of speaking. But that is not entirely true. Representing DNA
sequences as active causes ‘determining’ the organism is central to the
language of Neo-Darwinism. The active nature of this representation is clearly
intended.3 It is a hidden form of anthropomorphism and is one of the reasons
for the powerful influence Neo-Darwinist metaphors have had on social theory,
for example. The implication is that what is thought to apply to genes
justifies similar but often more literal language in social science. Even if
such language were justified at the level of genes it doesn't follow that it
is justified at any other level.

Yet, as we will see in this chapter and the next one, teleology is alive and
well because there is what we may call natural purposiveness,4 but it belongs
to the organism not its DNA. Representing DNA sequences as passive templates
would avoid the misleadingly anthropomorphic language of the gene-centric
popularisations.

Finally, Neo-Darwinism uses an outdated concept of programming to defend the
concept of a genetic programme. There are no complete ‘programmes’ within the
genome. All the logic of life necessarily includes other components of
organisms.

These are confusions of the kind that reveal when it is necessary for a
complete rethink. That is also the purpose of this chapter. The essential
points can be summarised as follows:

1. Recognise that the Weismann Barrier is a relative barrier rather than an absolute one.

2. Recognise that genetic variation is not always random with respect to function.

3. Recognise the existence of other forms of inheritance in addition to strict Mendelian inheritance.

4. Recognise that the Central Dogma of molecular biology is better represented as an important chemical fact about coding, rather than an absolute statement about control by and primacy of the genome.

5. Recognise the full significance of mobile genetic elements and the reorganisation of genomes.

6. Recognise the inheritance of epigenetic and similar Lamarckian forms.

7. Recognise the significance of symbiogenesis and many other forms of co-operation.

8. Recognise the significance of niche construction and the active role of organisms in evolution.

9. Recognise that evolution is a multi-mechanism process, that the Neo-Darwinian mechanism is just one of them, and that we really do not yet know the relative contribution of each process to each stage of evolution. This would be a return to Darwin's more nuanced view that other processes may also exist.

10. Respect the principle of Biological Relativity. The relativity principle applied to evolution is that nature may use mechanisms and selection at any scale, not just molecular. There is no privileged mechanism or scale for the transformation of species.

It is important to note that all of these criteria depend on experimental
evidence. This chapter will give an account of experimental evidence that
challenges the Weismann Barrier and the Central Dogma. [Chapter 8](book-
part8.html#CT-bp-8) will then do the same for epigenetics and related
processes. These two chapters therefore complement the conceptual analysis of
[Chapter 5](book-part5.html#CT-bp-5) by using the principle of Biological
Relativity outlined in [Chapter 6](book-part6.html#CT-bp-6).

### The Weismann Barrier is Relative, not Absolute

In [Chapter 5](book-part5.html#CT-bp-5) I described Weismann's fundamental
contributions to the two key assumptions of Neo-Darwinism: random causes of
variation and isolation of the germ line, which is the Weismann Barrier. I
also gave a partial answer to the question of how those ideas could have
become so strongly held on the basis of experimental evidence that could not
even satisfy the basic criterion of being a valid test of the main idea of
Lamarckism. The answer was that the evidence from Weismann's tail experiments
was never thought by him to be sufficient and that he had formulated the
essential principles of Neo-Darwinism well before he performed those
experiments (Figure 7.2).

![](../Images/17624fig7_2.png)

Figure 7.2

Hardy, Sir Alister. The Living Stream. Collins, London, 1965 (p. 76).

We have to look elsewhere for the origin of Weismann's ideas. To do this I
will draw on some of the conclusions of [Chapter 1](book-part1.html#CT-bp-1).
Neo-Darwinism is a product of nineteenth-century scientific thought in the
last decades before the revolutions in physics leading to quantum mechanics
and relativity theory. As we saw in [Chapter 6](book-part6.html#CT-bp-6), this
period was the heyday of mechanistic thought. From this perspective the
universe is a giant piece of clockwork. It was seen as hard, irreducible
elements, the postulated indivisible atoms, bouncing into each other like
billiard balls, and influencing their movements also by forces at a distance,
like gravity and electromagnetism, to produce a process that, in principle,
could be completely predicted from classical mechanics. This is the origin of
the Laplacian ‘god's-eye’ view. An all-knowing intelligent being could,
through the equations, understand precisely what would happen in the future,
and what must have happened in the past. All that was required was the data on
the positions and velocities of all the elements. As we saw in the last
chapter, that is both the loophole in the theory and, even more serious, it is
an impossible condition.

But, for the moment, let's ignore those problems and explore this viewpoint
because it was so profoundly influential that even biologists who appreciated
the systems approach were captivated by its system of thought. To illustrate
this influence particularly as it affected biological thought, consider the
work of the greatest physiologist of the nineteenth century, Claude Bernard.

Claude Bernard was a consummate experimentalist. He revealed the functions of
the liver, pancreas and other organs of the body. He pioneered the
understanding of digestion. In many ways he can be said to have initiated the
field of experimental physiology, and was widely appreciated to have done so
when the Physiological Society in the UK was founded in 1876. He was also a
great theoretician. His book, Introduction to the Study of Experimental
Medicine, published in French in 1865, was ground-breaking in the sweep of its
ideas. Well before the great systems physiologists of the twentieth century,
he formulated the principle of homeostasis, according to which living
organisms are characterised by the control they exert over their bodies. He
called this the maintenance of the constancy of the internal environment. By
internal environment he meant the liquid environment of the cells, tissue and
organs of the body. Temperature (in warm-blooded animals), pressure and many
other variables, now known to include acidity, salt concentrations and
metabolite concentrations, are all kept within certain bounds by feedback
processes. Although he did not use the term feedback, this is what his theory
entailed. I believe therefore that he has a good claim to be the first systems
biologist in the modern sense of the word.5

He even foresaw that this would require the use of mathematics in biology:
‘[The] application of mathematics to natural phenomena is the aim of all
science, because the expression of the laws of phenomena should always be
mathematical.’ This is the quotation I used in the brief autobiographical
sketch at the beginning of the last chapter in the context of the ultimate
form of reductionism. I repeat it here in a different context: that of the
pervasive influence of the mathematically precise clockwork view of the
universe in the mid-nineteenth century, described in [Chapter 1](book-
part1.html#CT-bp-1).

The influence of Laplacian determinism can also be seen in his arguments
against those who he suspected of reviving the idea of vitalism. Bernard was
insistent: to suppose that the world was anything other than mechanically
determinate would be to deny the very possibility of science. We can now see
that this is far too restrictive as a view on what can count as science.6
After the revolutions in physics produced by relativity theory and quantum
mechanics, science managed perfectly well with probabilities rather than
certainties. Given the extent of the stochasticity we have discovered in
biology, it too has to deal in probabilities. A nineteenth-century systems
physiologist like Claude Bernard has therefore to be seen in the context of
his period.

So should August Weismann. I believe that this is the important clue to some
of Weismann's ideas, which also need to be seen in the context of the period
in which he lived. Weismann was born about two decades after Bernard, but he
also must have been greatly influenced by nineteenth-century certainties
amongst scientists concerning the determinate ma-terialistic nature of the
universe. As Weismann's tail-amputating experiments showed, he was also
determined to oppose what he regarded as occult, even mystical ideas,
including the weirder forms of Lamarckism.

This motivation carried right through to the formulation of the Modern
Synthesis, and to the dogmatic forms of Neo-Darwinism that we have seen today
in its popularisation. The revolution in physics passed by unnoticed. An
important message of this book is that it should not have done so. Applying
the relativity principle to biology produces a complete change in viewpoint.
As we will see in this and the [next chapter](book-part8.html#CT-bp-8), the
genome is not completely isolated. The Weismann Barrier should be seen as a
relative – not absolute – barrier in the minority of organisms with a separate
line of germ cells. In these organisms special mechanisms are required to
circumvent the barrier. Such mechanisms are now known to exist. Weismann was
not wrong to identify the barrier. The mistake was to treat it as absolute.

### Genetic Variation is not Random

Defining what is meant by ‘random’ is itself a major field of enquiry in
mathematics, computation and in science generally. The question of whether
there are truly random events in the universe is a vexed one. As we saw in
[Chapter 1](book-part1.html#CT-bp-1), this question lies at the heart of
theories of quantum mechanics. Probably, we will never know, perhaps cannot
know in principle, the answer to that kind of question. But it warns us that
defining randomness is not easy.

The best way to sidestep these deeper problems is to ask an easier and more
specific question: ‘random with respect to what?’. In evolutionary theory that
makes the problem much simpler. Both Neo-Darwinists and their opponents can
then agree that what is really meant is ‘random with respect to physiological
(phenotypic) function’. That is so because one of the central tenets of Neo-
Darwinism is the exclusion of any form of Lamarckism. By contrast, a
Lamarckian must maintain that at least some changes are not completely random
with respect to function.

We can approach this question in three stages. The first stage is to establish
that genomic change is not random with respect to location in the genome. The
reason for asking that question first is that without establishing that there
are preferred locations of change, the argument for any kind of functionally
relevant change in the genome cannot even get off the ground. The only way in
which such a change can occur is through influencing the physical and chemical
properties of the genetic material. Preferred locations of change are
therefore a pre-condition for functional change in genome sequences to be
possible. If all locations in the genome were equally open to changes, there
would be no possibility for functionally relevant change.

Of course, demonstrating the existence of hotspots and other ways in which
change is not randomly distributed with respect to location does not, in and
of itself, demonstrate any form of functionally relevant change. The existence
of hotspots could be simply a consequence of the physico-chemical properties
of the genome and its associated proteins even if no functionally relevant
changes occur. Further experimentation is required to determine whether
evolution could use such mechanisms in a functional way.

The second stage in the argument is to note that well-documented examples of
functionally relevant genomic change already exist. The best-investigated case
is the evolution of lymphocytes. The germ line has only a finite amount of
DNA. In order to react to many different antigens, lymphocytes ‘evolve’
quickly to generate extensive antigen-binding variability. There can be as
many as 1012 different antibody specificities in the mammalian immune system,
and the detailed mechanisms for achieving this have been known for many years.
The mechanism is directed, because the binding of the antigen to the antibody
itself activates the proliferation process. The antigen activates special
lymphocytes (cells in the blood stream) called B-cells, which evolve rapidly
to generate a huge range of antigen-binding variability.7 Targeted speeding-up
of change is therefore one mechanism by which functional change can occur.
That is true even if the individual changes at that location are random. The
functionality lies in the targeting of the location. That targeting is not
random.

A possible objection to this example would be to say that the non-random
occurrence of hotspots in the genome was itself a result of evolution, which
could have been the result of random change followed by natural selection.
Indeed, that is possible. But it remains true to say that the organism is
thereby endowed with a natural purposiveness, however that may have arisen.
The organism can use that natural purposiveness to seek non-random changes in
response to an environmental stimulus. There is a kind of bootstrapping here.
Once a form of natural purposiveness has evolved it can be used to ensure that
subsequent evolutionary change is not generated randomly.

The example from the immune system is not, of course, an example of trans-
generational inheritance. The immune system evolves in the lifetime of an
individual and, in the case of mammals, the period spent in the womb.8 We will
now consider examples that resemble the evolution of the immune system, but
also involve trans-generational effects.

A well-known functionally driven form of genome change is the response to
starvation in bacteria. Starvation can increase the targeted reorganisations
of the genome by five orders of magnitude, i.e. by a factor of over 100,000.
This is one of the mechanisms by which bacteria can evolve very rapidly and in
a functional way in response to environmental stress. As we saw in [Chapter
4](book-part4.html#CT-bp-4), some forms of DNA transfer in micro-organisms are
also functional since they are activated as a response to a stressful
environment. That is precisely when organisms need to find a new solution to
the problem they have encountered.9

A similar targeting of location where genomic change can occur has been found
in experiments on genetically modified fruit flies. One of the common ways in
which genetic modification is achieved is to use a particular kind of mobile
genetic element that can move around the genome using a cut-and-paste
mechanism that does not require an RNA intermediate. Most often the insertions
occur in a random way. But when DNA sequences from certain regulatory regions
are used, they get inserted preferentially near the gene from which the
sequence was derived.10 This process targets the changes in a way that is
clearly not random with respect to possible function.

The third stage in the argument is experimental demonstration that the
inheritance of acquired characteristics occurs. There are now many examples of
that, some of which I will use as examples in a later section and in the [next
chapter](book-part8.html#CT-bp-8). Those experimental results require
functional inherited change, either genetically or epigenetically, even if we
do not yet know the molecular mechanisms.

All these stages of the argument are necessary.

### Misinterpretations of the Central Dogma

The Central Dogma of molecular biology was originally formulated by Francis
Crick in 1956 following the discovery of the triplet code, in which each amino
acid in a protein corresponds to three bases in the DNA or RNA. The coding
between nucleic acid sequences and amino acid sequences works only one way.
Triplets of nucleic acids in DNA or RNA code for an amino acid, but amino acid
sequences in proteins do not code for nucleic acid sequences or for amino acid
sequences in other proteins. The discovery of the triplet code was a major
step forward. But the choice of the word ‘dogma’ was unfortunate.11 Science
does not deal in dogmas. The use of the word in this particular case has been
particularly confusing because the experimental observation has also been
widely misinterpreted.

It seemed to many people that the Central Dogma confirms the Weismann Barrier
idea. But this is not and cannot be the case. The dogma was misinterpreted to
mean that information could not pass from the organism and environment to the
genome. To quote The Selfish Gene, genes are ‘sealed off from the outside
world’. This is simply incorrect, and it is not even justified by the Central
Dogma. It is important therefore to note that Crick's original statement of
the dogma was qualified in two very important respects:

The central dogma of molecular biology deals with the detailed residue-by-
residue transfer of sequential information. It states that such information
cannot be transferred back from protein to either protein or nucleic acid.

I have italicised ‘such information’ and ‘from protein’ since it is evident
that the statement does not say that no information can pass from the organism
to the genome. Crick would have known that absolute isolation of the genome
from control information could not be true. How else could the same genome be
used by the many different cells, tissue and organs of the body to generate
very different phenotypes? Note also that the statement refers to transfer
back from proteins. The information that regulates gene expression via
transcription factors and epigenetic marks comes, of course, from the networks
as a whole, not from individual proteins, although the final message is
conveyed by proteins called transcription factors. It is the pattern of such
factors that is important, and that it is a global property of the cells,
tissues and organs involved. There are many possible patterns of transcription
factors, each of which corresponds to a different phenotype outcome. The
information that passes from the system to the genome is of a different kind
to that involved in coding. It is not a property of individual molecular
sequences, but rather a property of an ensemble.

In 1956 it must have seemed secure at least to interpret the Central Dogma to
exclude changes in the DNA code itself. The control might have been restricted
to determining gene expression patterns, so leaving the sequence itself secure
against changes. The discovery of the process of transcription of RNAs back
into DNA (using an enzyme appropriately called reverse transcriptase) shook
that assumption and led Crick to modify the statement in 1970 to include this
possibility. It seemed, however, that the use of the Central Dogma to support
the Weismann Barrier might still be secure since the reverse transcription was
from RNA sequences, not from protein sequences. The revision of the dogma is
illustrated in Figure 7.3.

![](../Images/17624fig7_3.png)

Figure 7.3

Central Dogma after discovery of reverse transcription. DNA codes for RNA
which then codes for proteins (white curved arrows). RNA can be reverse
transcribed into DNA (upward white arrow). This kind of diagram is often
described as defining the information flows in biological systems. But it
omits information flows that control gene expression, i.e. transcription
factors, methylation and interactions with histones. It also omits the use of
the molecular mechanism of reverse transcription to reorganise the genome. The
circular arrows represent the fact that DNA can also be involved in cut-and-
paste modifications of the genome without the involvement of RNA, and that a
similar self-templating can occur in RNA.

Notice, however, that the diagram is incomplete since it does not include any
flow of information from the organism that controls patterns of gene
expression, and which might initiate or control insertion of DNA into the
genome either directly or following reverse transcription from RNA. Yet, by
reverse transcription, it becomes possible to transfer sequences, including
whole domains corresponding to functional parts of proteins, from one part of
the genome to another. As we will see in the next section, that must have
happened during evolution. The idea that the genome is isolated from any
functional influences on the sequences is therefore simply incorrect.

I sometimes describe this misinterpretation as the great mistake of molecular
biology. There is nothing wrong with the molecular biology experiments and the
observations on the direction of coding. That is a straightforward and correct
chemical observation. The mistake was one of interpretation, that the results
confirm the Weismann Barrier assumption in Neo-Darwinism. The discovery of
reverse transcription should have been a warning signal. That reverse
transcription has immense significance for evolutionary biology was soon
noticed by the greatest logician of science of the twentieth century: Karl
Popper.

It is not widely known that Popper gave an important lecture to the Royal
Society in 1986, entitled ‘A new interpretation of Darwinism’. It was given in
the presence of the Nobel laureates Sir Peter Medawar, Max Perutz and other
key figures, and it must have shocked his audience. He proposed a completely
radical interpretation of Neo-Darwinism, essentially rejecting the Modern
Synthesis by proposing that organisms themselves are the source of the
creative processes in evolution, not random mutations in DNA. He said that
Darwinism (but I am sure he meant Neo-Darwinism) was not so much wrong as
seriously incomplete. He saw that reverse transcription, which is the process
that allows DNA segments to be transported from one region of the genome to
another via an RNA intermediate, greatly weakens the Central Dogma. In
particular, it weakens the dogma in justifying Neo-Darwinist theory since it
changes the genome from the read-only idea of Neo-Darwinism to a read–write
genome.

He was therefore deeply suspicious of sophisticated manoeuvrings and
redefinitions to protect the dogma from falsification. In his ‘conjectures and
refutations’ view of science it is better to acknowledge when a strong version
of a theory has been refuted. The strong Neo-Darwinist interpretation of the
Central Dogma was refuted. But he went further than this. He saw that reverse
transcription could be one of the routes through which Lamarckian processes
and wholesale reorganisation of genomes could occur. Again, the philosopher in
him wanted to see this recognised, not hidden behind a web of clever re-
interpretations. I will return later in this chapter to the reasons why
Popper's lecture is not widely known.12

### Mobile Genetic Elements

Barbara McClintock was an American plant biologist working on maize (Indian
corn) in the 1920s and 1930s. She was visualising chromosomes when she noticed
that chromosomes recombine and exchange information during reproduction. In
the 1940s and 1950s she made the ground-breaking discovery of transposition of
genes. Parts of the genetic material could move from one location to another.
Her work was received with such deep scepticism that she ceased publishing on
her major discovery in 1953. Thirty years later, at the age of 81, she was
awarded the Nobel Prize for Physiology and Medicine for the discovery of
mobile genetic elements.

In an article in Science based on her Nobel Prize lecture she wrote:

In the future attention undoubtedly will be centered on the genome, and with
greater appreciation of its significance as a highly sensitive organ of the
cell, monitoring genomic activities and correcting common errors, sensing the
unusual and unexpected events, and responding to them, often by restructuring
the genome. We know about the components of genomes that could be made
available for such restructuring. We know nothing, however, about how the cell
senses danger and instigates responses to it that often are truly
remarkable.13

The italics are mine. Her statement that the genome is a highly sensitive
organ of the cell gets causation the right way round. It is cells, and
organisms, that display active behaviour. The genome is passive until
activated. She also realised the importance of her discovery of mobile genetic
elements in the ability of organisms to restructure the genome.14

The mechanisms of transposable elements therefore illustrate one of the
important breaks with the Central Dogma of molecular biology. Retrotransposons
are DNA sequences that are first copied as RNA sequences, which are then
inserted back into a different part of the genome using reverse transcriptase.
DNA transposons may also use a cut-and-paste mechanism that does not require
an RNA intermediate.

We now know that these mechanisms are used extensively in genome evolution. In
a major book on The Concept of the Gene in Development and Evolution in 2008,
Peter Beurton and his co-authors write: ‘it seems that a cell's enzymes are
capable of actively manipulating DNA to do this or that. A genome consists
largely of semi-stable genetic elements that may be rearranged or even moved
around in the genome thus modifying the information content of DNA.’ The
Australian specialist on RNAs and plasticity John Mattick expressed a similar
sentiment when he wrote ‘the belief that the soma and germ line do not
communicate is patently incorrect’.15

The Central Dogma, as a general principle of biology, has therefore been
progressively undermined until it has become useless as support for the Modern
Synthesis or even as an accurate description of what happens in cells. All
that remains is the chemical fact that protein sequences do not code for
nucleic acid sequences, which is what the impressive molecular biological
experiments actually showed. That chemical fact, together with the triplet
coding, and the roles of RNAs as intermediates, all remain as great
achievements, but they do not justify a DNA-centric view of life.

### Natural Genetic Engineering: Genome Reorganisation

The experimental evidence that wholesale reorganisation of genomes has
occurred during evolution shows that genomes did not always evolve by gradual
accumulation of random small mutations. Some of the best evidence has come
from genome sequencing of different species. Of course, the species that exist
today are not the historical species that formed the branching ‘tree of life’
or the modern network version ([Figure 4.10](book-part4.html#FIG-fig-30))
during evolution, but their genomes nevertheless contain the tell-tale signs
of what must have happened. Figure 7.4 is based on an illustration in the 2001
Nature article reporting the first full draft sequence of the human genome,16
and it compares the structure of certain proteins in a variety of species,
including yeast, worm, fly, vertebrates and human.

![](../Images/17624fig7_4.png)

Figure 7.4

Evidence for how gene domains must have moved around during evolution to form
different functional proteins by domain accretion. This figure shows
diagrammatic representations of three groups of individual proteins that
contribute to the formation of chromatin, the backbone of chromosomes. Each
coloured shape shows a single protein domain. Each protein is made up of
several domains. In each case, as we move from yeast (unicellular) to worm,
fly, various vertebrates and the human, the number of domains increases. The
significant fact is that the development from one to the other did not occur
by gradual accumulation of small mutations. Instead, whole domains hundreds of
amino acids in length have come together to form the new protein. The red
stars show the domains that must have moved in this way. It is extremely
unlikely that this result could have been achieved by gradual accumulation of
small random mutations. Reproduced with permission. For full details of the
domains and proteins involved, see the original Nature paper at
[www.nature.com/nature/journal/v409/n6822/fig_tab/409860a0_F42.html](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v409/n6822/fig_tab/409860a0_F42.html).

The two classes of proteins that show this phenomenon of domain accretion very
clearly are chromatin binding proteins and transcription factors, both of
which are involved in the structure and regulation of the genome. The
structure of the chromatin determines how loosely or tightly the DNA is wound
around it. In turn, that determines how easily the proteins that form the
transcription apparatus can move along the DNA molecular thread to read it.
Significantly, organisms have reorganised their genomes through natural
genetic engineering, forming templates for the proteins that are most
intimately involved in controlling the genome and the way in which it is read.

The standard Neo-Darwinist interpretation of this discovery is to call such
reorganisations of the genome ‘large mutations’. That obscures their great
significance. The domains have functionality. They might be essential for a
particular protein receptor, or its overall structure, possible conformation
changes or any other functional property. These ‘large mutations’ are
therefore variations that move and create new proteins that are much more
likely to be functional than creation via accumulation of random small
mutations. It obscures this fundamental difference to conflate the two
mechanisms. Evolution has been quite conservative in producing completely new
DNA sequences, which is why so many species share great proportions of their
genomes. The differences between a worm, a fly, a mouse or a human have more
to do with wholesale reorganisation and regulation of the genome than with
completely new sequences. It seems to me to be more honest that we should
admit that this is far from what was anticipated by the architects of Neo-
Darwinism. In spirit, at least, that theory is a gradualist one so far as
mutations are concerned.

We may also speculate that the insertions of whole domains into new parts of
the genome may have been far from random with respect to location.17 A
mechanism comparable to that used by the immune system (see pages 195–196) may
have greatly improved the chances of new functions arising.18

To appreciate the full significance of these mechanisms by which whole domains
can be moved around in the genome, imagine two children playing with a
construction kit like Lego. To one child we give a pile of the original simple
Lego bricks. To the other we also include many preformed shapes. It is obvious
that when asked to make any construction that requires the preformed shapes
the second child will succeed much faster than the first. In the same way,
evolution is much more likely to generate successful novel organisms if it can
‘play’ with preformed DNA domains. Existing functionality is transferred into
forming new combinations.

These arguments and the supporting evidence do not of course exclude the
process of evolution of proteins by gradual change. Sequence studies of
haemoglobin proteins in different species show that such gradual change also
occurs.

### Significance of Symbiogenesis and Co-operation

Moving whole functional domains of DNA around in the genome is impressive
enough, but what about moving or combining whole genomes? This is the process
called symbiogenesis.

The mother of symbiogenesis in evolution was surely Lynn Margulis.19 I was
privileged to interact with her during a year when she came from Amherst,
Massachusetts in the USA to be a visiting professor at Oxford University in
2008–2009\. I already knew that mitochondria in the cells of animals and
plastids in the cells of plants were thought to have arisen from fusion
between early forms of unicellular organisms and particular forms of bacteria,
the ancestors of mitochondria and plastids. But it was not until that year of
intense discussion with Margulis that I realised the full significance of what
she and others had done in this important area of biology. She insisted that I
should chair what has now become a famous debate between her and Richard
Dawkins, recorded by the video team Voices from Oxford.20 It became impossible
to think of cells – any cells, in any species – without seeing them as the
miracle of co-operation that they represent.

It is hard to think of the evolution of eukaryotes – the kinds of cells that
form your and my bodies, packed as they are with nuclei and organelles – as
anything other than a major step in evolutionary history. It is what made
possible the evolution of highly organised organisms, plants and the whole of
the animal kingdom. Yet it is impossible to explain such a critical step as
simply the outcome of chance mutations in the genomes of prokaryotes followed
by natural selection. Before that evolutionary threshold was passed, it was
impossible for organisms with separate germ cell lines to exist. The Weismann
Barrier and the original basis of Neo-Darwinist theory would have been
irrelevant. Yet the great majority of time during which life has evolved on
Earth occurred before this threshold. When you realise that, Neo-Darwinism
takes on a different historical significance. If and when we do find life on
other planets, it is quite possible that Neo-Darwinism would be irrelevant for
understanding its evolution. The great majority of life on other planets may
never have passed this threshold.

We don't know how rapidly the symbiogenetic events leading to eukaryotes may
have happened. A simple stage of ingestion of a bacterium by a prokaryotic
cell would have been virtually instantaneous of course: just gobble the goody!
But there must have been many other stages.21 Instead of being eaten up for
fuel, the ingested bacterium would have needed to survive inside and prove
beneficial to its host, while the host would have needed to be beneficial to
the bacterium. We know also that much of the DNA of bacterial origin
subsequently moved to the nuclear genome, presumably by the transposition
mechanisms discussed earlier in this chapter. Only a small amount of DNA now
remains in mitochondria and chloroplasts. That would have involved many steps
of natural genetic engineering.22

Having absorbed all of these insights, I was naturally intrigued to see what a
debate between Dawkins as a prominent Neo-Darwinist and Margulis as a champion
of symbiogenesis and other forms of co-operation would reveal. The recording
of the debate and transcript23 are both accessible via the internet, so
readers can view and read them to form their own judgements. I think the
debate revealed two things of importance in this book. First, a Neo-Darwinist
like Dawkins appears initially to see no problem in absorbing symbiogenesis
into the theory. The early part of the transcript includes the statement
‘Lynn, I don't think you go far enough.’ This is a common Neo-Darwinist tactic
that seems to explain everything but in so doing explains nothing.24

But much later, as I noted in [Chapter 5](book-part5.html#CT-bp-5), Dawkins
challenges Margulis to justify why she needed to bring symbiogenesis into the
picture when Neo-Darwinism is both sufficient and the most parsimonious
hypothesis. Of course, it is unfair to pin anyone down to the precise words
they may use in an impromptu debate. But, if we look at the way in which Neo-
Darwinism developed, and understand the spirit in which it was formulated,
then the second intervention is much more in line with that spirit than the
initial one. The emphasis in Neo-Darwinism is on chance occurrence and gradual
accumulation of small changes. Symbiogenesis, by contrast, is the fusion of
whole genomes into a single new organism.25 It is the very essence of co-
operation in nature. The classical Neo-Darwinist cap doesn't fit it. Yet it
was responsible for one of the most important stages in the evolution of life
on Earth.

I am a biased observer of course, and I was the chairman of the
Margulis–Dawkins debate. The conclusions I draw from it are, first, that
Richard Dawkins was the more effective debater. But Lynn was surely right to
argue that symbiogenesis was responsible for an extremely important step in
evolution: the emergence of eukaryotes, organisms with cells like those found
in you and me.

Does symbiogenesis still happen, or was it just an early stage in evolutionary
history? That depends on what precisely we include in symbiogenesis. It
doesn't need to involve the fusion of whole genomes. By this criterion, we
humans and all multicellular organisms are symbionts. We co-operate with a
vast number of bacteria that serve necessary functions for us, as we do for
them. In fact, as I noted in [Chapter 4](book-part4.html#CT-bp-4), there are
many more bacteria in us than cells with our own genome. Their total DNA
complement is at least 250 times larger than our own. Those bacterial
populations evolve quickly, which is fortunate if we have to change diet.

Transfer of DNA between bacteria and the host can also occur. It has happened
in the case of gut bacteria in insects, one of the best examples of DNA
transfer not just between different species, but across different kingdoms of
organisms.26 An even more remarkable case of horizontal DNA transfer involves
nucleotide sequences from three separate kingdoms contributing to the
mechanisms by which tiny animals called rotifers can resist extreme
desiccation. The DNA sequences involved were acquired from fungi and bacteria
and they contribute around 8% of the animal's genome.27 Transfer of DNA
between green algae and a sea slug has been shown to be responsible for a
remarkable ability of the sea slug to photosynthesise. Algal DNA has not only
been transferred to the host, but has been incorporated into the sea slug's
genome.28

I conclude that symbiogenesis is still alive and well, kicking away
successfully, most particularly in our own bellies.29 It is also responsible
for some of the forms of non-Mendelian inheritance.30

Moreover, many other forms of co-operation are alive and rampant everywhere in
nature and at all levels of biological organisation, a point that has been
argued very forcibly in a recent book by Martin Nowak and Roger Highfield.31

### Conclusions

It is the ‘atomistic’ gene-centric nature of Neo-Darwinism that is the main
problem with the theory. In its modern interpretation, it gives to a molecule,
DNA, the primary causal role in evolutionary change, through chance non-
functional variations in its sequences. Molecules are important, of course,
but they are not alive. Outside an organism DNA can do nothing at all. It is
better regarded as forming templates in a database that the organism and its
progeny can use. The correct direction of causality is from the organism to
its genome. As Barbara McClintock wrote in her 1983 Nobel Prize lecture, ‘the
genome is an organ of the cell’.

The reason is that the Weismann Barrier is not an absolute barrier. That is so
even in the relatively small proportion of organisms that have a separate germ
line. The genome is not isolated from the rest of the organism or from the
environment. It can be changed by the processes of natural genetic
engineering.

This chapter sets the scene for the next one, in which we reveal the extent to
which the genome is controlled by the organism through epigenetic processes.
It will be through understanding those processes that we can progress to a
view of evolutionary biology that respects the principle of Biological
Relativity.

### Notes

1 The history of this guitar has now come full circle. After playing it for
several years, Christoph Denoth generously agreed with me to donate it to my
brother, Raymond Noble, who uses it to compose music for medieval Trobador
songs for which the music has been lost. He confirms the sweetness of the tone
and its bell-like quality. Ray's involvement, as a scientist and philosopher,
in the ideas of this book are acknowledged at the beginning of [Chapter
6](book-part6.html#CT-bp-6). He is also a brilliant musician as lead singer in
the Oxford Trobadors.

2 James Watson may have been the first to use the template idea: ‘I jokingly
used to say, well it was either the template for protein synthesis or it was
there to control the viscosity of a cell. Now the latter was a private joke
between Francis and I, ‘cause he'd spent several years measuring the viscosity
of cells, something which I think he later realized was a total waste of time.
So I said it's a template.’ Interview at [www.dnalc.org/view/15474-RNA-s-role-
in-the-cell-James-Watson.html](http://www.dnalc.org/view/15474-RNA-s-role-in-
the-cell-James-Watson.html).

3 Richard Dawkins originally thought that ‘selfish’ was not a metaphor, but to
be interpreted literally: Dawkins, R. (1981) In defence of selfish genes.
Philosophy 56:556–573. The reason given is worth quoting in full: ‘that was no
metaphor. I believe it is the literal truth, provided certain key words are
defined in the particular ways favoured by biologists.’ But a metaphor does
not cease to be a metaphor simply because one defines a word to mean something
other than its normal meaning. Indeed, it is the function of metaphor to do
precisely this.

4 Some biologists use the term ‘natural intelligence’ for what I have called
‘natural purposiveness’. I have chosen the second form to avoid some of the
deeper philosophical questions arising from the use of ‘intelligence’.

basis of the theory of facilitated variation proposed by Kirschner, M. and J.
Gerhart (2010) Facilitated variation, in evolution. In The Extended Synthesis,
M. Pigliucci and G. Müller, editors (MIT Press, Cambridge, MA).

Yoav Soen and his colleagues have proposed that organisms may harness random
variation in a process of adaptive improvisation, by which adaptive changes
can be transmitted across generations, allowing rapid improvement and
assimilation in a few generations. Adaptive improvisation ‘provides a basis

The detailed molecular mechanisms by which bacteria can achieve rapid
evolution in response to environmental stress have been revealed by Bos, J.,
Q. Zhang, S. Vyawahare, et al. (2015) Emergence of antibiotic resistance from
multinucleated bacterial filaments. PNAS 112:178–183. The SOS response to an
antibiotic, ciprofloxacin, consists in creating multiple chromosomal
filaments, which may then evolve via recombinant transfer of DNA between the
multiple chromosomes: ‘the strategy of generating multiple mutant chromosomes
within a single cell may represent a widespread and conserved mechanism for
the rapid evolution of genome change in response to unfavorable environments
(i.e., chemo-therapy drugs and antibiotics)’.

Louise Johnson's lab in Reading University has shown that bacteria that have
lost their flagella through deletion of the relevant DNA sequence can evolve
the regulatory networks required to restore flagella and so restore motility
in response to a stressful environment within just four days. Taylor, T.B., G.
Mulley, A.H. Dills, et al. (2015) Evolutionary resurrection of flagellar
motility via rewiring of the nitrogen regulation system. Science
347:1014–1017. The editor's summary reads: ‘Two stereotypical mutations
diverted an evolutionarily related regulator that normally controls nitrogen
uptake to control flagella biosynthesis. The mutations increased the levels of
the co-opted regulator, then altered its specificity for the flagella
pathway.’

14 Transposing long sequences breaks the dogma of genetic change being purely
random since these can be sequences that already have functional significance
with a greater probability than chance. Novelty in the evolutionary process
does not therefore have to wait for gradual accumulation of random point
mutations. Imagine a child playing with a construction toy. If all the child
has is a pile of small bricks, then it will have to create whatever it wishes
to make by small accretions. But if the child has a collection of already-
formed shapes the construction can be much faster and more guided by whatever
already exists. This is the process of conditioned arising. In the
evolutionary process it must greatly increase the chances of functional
novelty arising.

18 There are various ways in which organisms might harness chance variations
to achieve functional inherited change. Yoav Soen has analysed such a process,
which depends on feedback between stress and mutation rates, similar to that
employed by the immune system. Favourable mutations would reduce stress and
vice versa. This would automatically lead to functional change. Soen, Y., M.
Knafo and M. Elgart (2015) A principle of organisation which facilitates broad
Lamarckian-like adaptations by improvisation. Biology Direct 10:68. This is
also a good example of stochasticity at low (molecular) levels ‘hiding’
functional change at higher levels. Stress is a systems property of the whole
organism and would not be ‘seen’ at the molecular level. Soen et al. also show
how the hypothesis can be tested experimentally. See also note 10 above.

19 Margulis did, however, freely acknowledge her antecedents, including
notably the Russian scientist Constantine Mereschowsky, who argued as early as
1905 that chloroplasts derived from cyanobacteria, while another Russian,
Vladimir Kozo-Polyanski, later extended the idea to mitochondria.

## 8 Epigenetics and a Relativistic Theory of Evolution

The progressive triumph of physiology over molecular biology.

Sir James Black, Nobel Prize winner for drug discovery, The Logic of Life,
1993.

### Epigenetics Viewed from Physiological High Ground

I came into epigenetics by the back door. It often happens in scientific
research that you can never know where an unexpected finding will lead you. My
research team in 1979 was working on the natural rhythm generator of the
heart: a small strip of tissue called the sinus node. It sends regular waves
of excitation to the rest of the heart, which then causes it to beat
rhythmically. Our earlier work had identified a rhythm-generating channel in
another region of the heart. We were looking for the same channel in the sinus
node. A young Italian scientist, Dario DiFrancesco, was working with my wife,
Susan Noble, and a colleague, Hilary Brown, to perform the difficult
dissections and recordings. The result was a paper in Nature1 identifying the
current through the channel, which they called if (following the lab jargon
which dubbed it the ‘funny current’), and that it was increased by the heart's
natural accelerator, adrenaline. Why ‘funny’, and why did this bit of lab
jargon become its usual name? There was a niggling doubt about its origin. It
was called ‘funny’ because of that doubt. They wrote ‘we have therefore been
unable to determine whether it has a reversal potential close to the
equilibrium potential for potassium ions’. The reader does not need to
understand the detail of this sentence, other than to know that a potassium
channel must have this.2

This little gap in the evidence widened into a huge chasm when, a year later,
Dario proved it to be a different class of protein channel altogether.3 For
the next five years he and I worked to completely reformulate the mathematical
theory of cardiac rhythm. The result was a seminal paper in 1985 that has
formed the basis of this field ever since.4 The mathematics of heart rhythm
has now become a huge field of research called the Cardiac Physiome.5 The
paper was featured by the Royal Society in 2015 as one of a select group of
papers to celebrate 350 years of publication of Philosophical Transactions. We
used it immediately in 1985 to derive an early model of rhythm in the sinus
node.6

There were two very important consequences of that work.

First, heart rhythm is a multiple fail-safe mechanism. Several different
networks of interactions can generate the rhythm, even when the most important
one is completely removed, either by a blocking drug or by genetic
manipulation (a knockout). In particular, block of the if channel would be
expected to gently slow the heart, not arrest it. This insight led to the
development by a French pharmaceutical company, Servier, of a drug called
ivabradine that is now used to treat patients for whom a frequency limiter of
this kind is necessary. Thousands of lives must already have been saved. For
the scientific basis of this development Dario DiFrancesco was awarded a
prestigious prize by the French Academy of Sciences.7

This example of drug discovery also follows the successful strategy used by
Sir James Black in his Nobel Prize work on beta-blockers and H2 receptor
antagonists.8 The method is to drill down from a high-level physiological
function to identify proteins that play a relevant role, and then to the DNA
that forms the template. The reverse process starting with the DNA database is
like looking for needles in haystacks.9 The correlations between DNA and
function are too weak for that to be a successful strategy, as shown by the
fact that 15 years after the first complete draft of the human genome the
number of successful clinical applications is far from fulfilling the dream.10

Second, this discovery is a practical illustration of the diagram in [Chapter
5](book-part5.html#CT-bp-5) showing the primary role of the networks in
relating genes to function. Networks form a screen through which it is
difficult for us to work out individual contributions of the many genes that
contribute their products to each function. In fact, it is sometimes
impossible without insight into those systems of interactions. In a systematic
study of knockouts in the unicellular organism yeast, 80% of knockouts were
found to be silent.11 It requires systems analysis of the response of the
organism to various forms of environmental stress to work out what is
happening. The general answer is that the networks can canalise the response
towards different functional processes. We shall discuss the meaning of the
word ‘canalise’ below, where I will also explain that canalisation of
development and of reactions to the environment is precisely the original
definition of epigenetics.

### Epigenetic and Other Lamarckian Inheritance

##### Conrad Waddington's Experiments

Epigenetics means ‘above genetics’ and it was originally conceived by the
great developmental biologist Conrad Waddington to describe the existence of
mechanisms of inheritance in addition to (over and above) standard genetics.
Waddington regarded himself as a Darwinist but, significantly, not a Neo-
Darwinist. He was a profound thinker about biology, and much else too. His
1957 book The Strategy of the Genes is a masterly account of the many reasons
for which he dissented from Neo-Darwinism, and it has stood the test of time.
It was reprinted over half a century later, in 2014. Many of his experiments
concerned the inheritance of acquired characteristics, and he discovered
several processes by which it could occur. He did not describe himself as a
Lamarckian, but by revealing mechanisms of inheritance of acquired
characteristics I think he should be (see glossary item on Lamarckism). The
reason he did not do so is that Lamarck could not have conceived of the
processes that Waddington revealed. That is correct, and it is also true to
say that Lamarck did not invent the idea of the inheritance of acquired
characteristics. But, whether historically correct or not, we are stuck today
with the term Lamarckian for this kind of inheritance.

Why did Waddington succeed experimentally where Weismann failed? Waddington
realised that the way to succeed in testing for the inheritance of acquired
characteristics is first to discover what forms of developmental plasticity
already exist in a population, or that the population could be persuaded to
demonstrate with a little nudging from the environment. This approach is more
finely nuanced than using surgery since it is playing into plasticity that is
already present. Surgery clearly does not achieve that since it is extremely
unlikely that natural plasticity should respond to non-functional surgery. By
exploiting plasticity that already existed, Waddington was much more likely to
mimic a path that evolution itself could have taken.

He used the word ‘canalised’ for this kind of persuasion since he represented
the developmental process as a series of ‘decisions’ that could be represented
as ‘valleys’ and ‘forks’ in a developmental landscape. He knew from his
developmental studies that embryo fruit flies could be persuaded to show
different wing structure simply by changing the environmental temperature or
by a chemical stimulus. In the developmental landscape this could be
represented as a small manipulation in slope that would lead to favouring one
channel in the landscape rather than another, so that the adult could show a
different phenotype starting from the same genotype.

The next step in his experiment was to select for and breed from the animals
that displayed the new characteristic. Exposed to the same environmental
stimulus these gave rise to progeny with an even higher proportion of adults
displaying the new character. After around 14 generations he found that he
could then breed from the animals and obtain robust inheritance of the new
character even without applying the environmental stimulus.12 The
characteristic had therefore become locked into the genetics of the animal. He
called this process genetic assimilation. The full significance of this
process of assimilation will become clearer in a later section on the origin
of species.

Orthodox Neo-Darwinists dismissed Waddington's findings as merely an example
of the evolution of phenotype plasticity. That is what you will find in many
of the biology textbooks. I think that is to misrepresent what Waddington
showed. Of course, plasticity can evolve, and that itself could be by a Neo-
Darwinist or Darwinist or any other mechanism. But Waddington was not simply
showing the evolution of plasticity in general; he was showing how it could be
exploited to enable a particular acquired characteristic in response to an
environmental change to be inherited and become assimilated into the genome.
To repeat: the characteristic was acquired as a result of an environmental
change, and it was inherited. That is the definition of Lamarckian inheritance
that I and many others now use. But the designation doesn't really matter.
What does is that he discovered a protocol by which an acquired characteristic
could be inherited. Evolution could have used the same kind of protocol.

What was happening at the gene level in Waddington's experiments? One
explanation might be that some mutations occurred. That is possible but
unlikely on the time scale of the experiments, which is just a few
generations. Remember that the Neo-Darwinist idea is that slow accumulation of
many small mutations eventually gets selected over many generations. Moreover,
random mutations would occur in individuals, not in a whole group. Even if the
correct combination of mutations did occur, they would have to be ones that
favoured the assimilation of the characteristic. That would be a Lamarckian
combination, a change that responds to the environmental change in a
functional way. It is difficult to see how that could have occurred. Single
small mutations would have taken many generations to spread through whole
populations, and many such mutations would have been required.

But I think there is a much simpler explanation. Recall that the experiments
exploited plasticity that is already present in the population. That strongly
suggests that all the alleles (gene variants) necessary for the inheritance of
the characteristic were already present in the population, but not initially
in any particular individuals in the correct combination. The experiment
simply brings them together. This is a modification of the pattern of the
genome in response to the environmental change, but not in a way that requires
any new mutations.

I came to this conclusion before reading The Strategy of the Genes. But it is
in fact one of Waddington's own ideas! He writes ‘There is no…reason which
would prevent us from imagining that all the genes which eventually make up
the assimilated genotype were already present in the population before the
selection began, and only required bringing together.’13 Not only does he
clearly see this possibility, he also tests it. He continues: ‘Attempts to
carry out genetic assimilation starting from inbred lines (that is, stocks
with no genetic variability) have remained quite unsuccessful. This provides
further evidence that the process depends on the utilisation of genetic
variability in the foundation stock with which the experiment begins.’14 His
text could not be clearer. Yet his work was sidelined. I find it shameful that
this kind of denigration can be done in the name of science, just as it is
shameful that Lamarck is not recognised for what he achieved. These are the
reasons why the dogmatism of Neo-Darwinist popularisation has been damaging.
What was missed was the opportunity to develop an integrated, and what I would
call a relativistic, theory of evolution over 50 years ago. That is a long
time for an important lead to be ignored.

It would have been an integrated theory because it postulates multiple
mechanisms requiring a systems approach. It would have been relativistic
because it would have been multi-scale, including processes that do not depend
on a genes-eye view. Half a century later we are only now beginning to put the
pieces back together again into such a synthesis. Of course, such an
integrated relativistic theory builds on the undoubted successes and insights
of Neo-Darwinism, just as relativity theory in physics builds on Newtonian
mechanics. To repeat: Neo-Darwinism is not so much wrong as incomplete. So was
mechanics when quantum mechanics appeared.

##### Modern Epigenetic Mechanisms

The term epigenetics still refers to influences ‘above’ the genome, but has
acquired an additional meaning today which Waddington did not foresee.15 The
additional meaning refers to control of the genome by marking it, or the
proteins called histones around which it is wound, by means of chemical
modification. These marks change and so control the expression levels of
genes.

The idea of the genome being controlled by the rest of the organism is not,
however, new. It has been known for a long time that gene expression is
controlled by proteins called transcription factors that can bind to
particular regions of DNA that function as switches in the sense that binding
to them can switch genes on or off. The profile of these transcription factors
forms a kind of epigenetics since it determines the overall pattern of gene
expression, which in turn determines what kind of cell develops. More usually,
epigenetics refers to additional control mechanisms, including marking using
methylation of some of the nucleic acids, and binding to the tails of the
histone proteins. When this kind of epigenetics was first discovered it was
thought that these chemical marks were always removed in the germ line before
transmission to the next generation. More recent experiments have shown that
this is not always true. Moreover, in some cases it has been found that the
marks not only persist across generations but that the inheritance can
sometimes be just as strong as standard genetic inheritance.16

There is now an extensive and rapidly growing literature on the inheritance of
epigenetic variations.17 In this section I will use just four examples to
illustrate the very wide nature of the mechanisms involved. They represent
different ways in which nature has exploited leaks in the Weismann Barrier,
discussed in [Chapter 7](book-part7.html#CT-bp-7).

The tiny planarian worm, C. elegans, is a favourite organism for genetic and
molecular biological studies. It can be infected with a particular virus.
Organisms that possess the correct DNA can react to this environmental
stimulus by making an RNA that silences the virus, preventing it from using
the host mechanisms for reproduction. By breeding these worms with others that
do not have the relevant DNA, Oded Rechavi and his colleagues obtained worms
in subsequent generations that do not have the relevant DNA. Yet they still
inherit the acquired resistance to the virus.18 They do so by small quantities
of the viral-silencing RNA passing through the male germ line to be amplified
in each generation by an enzyme called RNA polymerase. The acquired
characteristic is transmitted in this way through at least 100 generations.
This example shows that the idea that an acquired characteristic will
necessarily die out after a few generations is not correct. It also reveals
that RNAs can also be transmitted through the germ line. DNA is not the only
inherited material.

Robust inheritance of an acquired epigenetic characteristic has been
demonstrated in mice by Joe Nadeau's group in Seattle. They worked on a family
of proteins that can insert mutations in DNA and RNA to show inheritance of
epigenetic marking. This shows that the genome is not completely wiped clean
of the marks in the germ line. On the contrary, Nadeau's work shows that such
inheritance can be just as robust as standard genetic inheritance and can
persist for many generations.19 Epi-genetic marking of the chromosome proteins
has also been shown to be inherited.20 The transmission of epigenetic marking
has recently been shown to play a role in the inheritance of obesity in
humans,21 while the transmission of RNAs in sperm mediates the transmission of
obesity in mice.22

Epigenetic mechanisms seem to be able to transmit memories of unpleasant
experiences. Kerry Ressler and Brian Dias at Emory University in the USA have
shown that mice can be trained to fear a particular chemical smell through
association of the smell with an electric shock. The progeny display the same
fear of the smell even though they were not trained to do so. The precise
epigenetic mechanism in this case remains to be discovered.23

Another mechanism by which evolution can use epigenetics to bypass the
Weismann Barrier is to transmit the epigenetic marks through behaviour. This
process has been demonstrated by Michael Meaney's group in Canada. Rodents,
like many other animals, groom their young by licking and stroking them. This
behaviour enhances the health and longevity of the progeny. It also influences
epigenetic marking in the region of the brain called the hippocampus which,
amongst other roles, plays a part in emotional behaviour. The epigenetic
effects can therefore predispose the progeny to show the same behaviour
towards their young. This form of epigenetic inheritance doesn't even require
transmission through the germ line. It is a behavioural way of bypassing the
Weismann Barrier.24

These examples suffice to show what is happening in modern epi-genetic
research.25 Can these and many other examples be dismissed as the rare
exceptions that, to use a common phrase, ‘prove the rule’? Could the Neo-
Darwinist synthesis live with that? After all, Newtonian physics lives on
despite the exceptions at the micro scale of quantum mechanics and the mega
scale of general relativity. Those exceptions really are negligible for the
spatial and time scales at which the physics of everyday life operates. We
continue to use Newton's equations successfully. In the case of the exceptions
to standard inheritance in evolutionary theory, this option is not open to us
precisely because those exceptions operate at the same spatial scales and over
the same time periods as the evolutionary process itself. Inheritance is
inheritance, whether it is genetic, epigenetic, RNA-based, culturally based or
whatever. All the inheritance processes end up doing the same thing, which is
to modify the organism. They are intricately interconnected so that selection
would not be able to distinguish between them. They also interact so much that
disentangling the genetic and epigenetic processes may be the wrong way to
look at the situation.26

But aren't the non-standard mechanisms rare? That is a good question and the
best answer at this early stage in research on epigenetic inheritance is that
we don't know how rare it may be compared to mutations in DNA. But rarity is
not really the issue. Speciation is also rare. Thousands of years of selection
of dogs, cats and fish have not resulted in new species by the standard
definitions, such as whether or not the variants can interbreed. Moreover, as
we will see in a later section of this chapter when we look at research on
Darwin's finches, epigenetic variation can be shown to be just as frequent as
or even more frequent than genetic variation.

### Niche Construction and the Active Role of Organisms

We saw in the [previous chapter](book-part7.html#CT-bp-7) that Karl Popper's
1986 lecture to the Royal Society anticipated the significance for
evolutionary theory of the discovery of reverse transcription. Popper's
lecture also contained a second major criticism of Neo-Darwinism.

This was based on his clear understanding of a phenomenon usually known as the
‘Baldwin effect’27 or ‘adaptability driver’.28 Organisms can choose new niches
for themselves and their descendants.29 Moving to a new niche can change the
course of evolution even with no mutations whatsoever. That choice is a
physiological characteristic of the phenotype, not a change in DNA. So how can
it change the course of evolution? The answer is surprisingly simple. In a
wild population in which individual genomes are not identical, the
combinations of alleles in the adventurous organisms discovering new niches
will be favoured. That is an evolution of the genome by combinatorial
selection, not selection of new random mutations.

It is not surprising that a logician like Popper should have immediately
understood the immense significance of this fact. To illustrate it he even
invented an imaginary world in which there was no competition for survival, no
‘selfish genes’. The organisms would still evolve. Of course, the world in
which such evolution could occur would have to be effectively infinite in size
to accommodate all the organisms that would develop. But this was just a
thought experiment familiar to scientific theorists and philosophers. Conrad
Waddington understood the same point.

Why, then, do selfish gene theorists ignore it? They do so by taking an
atomistic gene-centred view. From that viewpoint no new genes developed and
the process can be represented as not very different from random drift within
an existing gene pool, which I will discuss later in this chapter. From a
physiological or psychological functional viewpoint, however, the process is
an active choice of the organisms, including learnt behaviour. The causality
involved here is very far from random.30 Once the new niche choice has been
made, the functionality can become assimilated into the genome just as in
Waddington's experiments. As Popper also saw, it is the insistence on the
gene-centred approach that is the problem. By contrast, it is combinations of
genes, or rather combinatorial interactions between large numbers of their
products, RNAs and proteins, that are important functionally. What may appear
to be a random distribution of components at a molecular level may in fact
represent the particular pattern that has functional significance at a higher
level.

This is a very important and little-understood consequence of taking a
biological relativistic view. Interactions at a high level, which can be
clearly seen as functional, may not appear to be functional at a low level.
This is one of the reasons why Neo-Darwinists can use a gene-centric view to
claim that all variation is random with respect to function. The non-
randomness may only be evident if one takes a high-level perspective.

In addition to the fact that the functional pattern may not be visible at a
molecular level, most single genes contribute very little to complex
functions, which is why the correlations between genes and complex diseases
have been found to be a matter of large numbers of very small effects, still
summing up to a small overall fraction of causation. The atomistic view was
never going to be of much use in physiology and pathology. This is the point
made by Sir James Black in the quotation at the head of this chapter.

There is another reason why Popper was ignored. He never published his Royal
Society lecture! When he died at the age of 92 he was still in correspondence
with the Nobel laureate and director of the Cambridge Molecular Biology
laboratory Max Perutz, who he hoped to convince before he published. The
lecture was then locked up for 35 years in the Popper archive in the USA.
Fortunately, it has now been released and has been published as part of a
book, Karl Popper and the Two New Secrets of Life.

Niche construction and the adaptability driver are examples of natural
purposiveness. Organisms actively seek and create new niches.31

While standard evolutionary biology ignores the deep significance of the
adaptability driver,32 it has long acknowledged a related but much weaker form
of the idea. This is the idea of genetic drift. Even without a new niche the
offspring of organisms will not necessarily display the same distribution of
gene variants in their population as their parents. Over time, even a random
process can lead to change.33 The adaptability driver adds the important
consequence of some members of a population actively choosing or creating a
new niche. The causation is at the level of the phenotype, not the genotype.

### The Origin of Species?

Despite the title of Darwin's famous book, we cannot be sure to what extent
natural selection acting on gradual accumulation of small mutations has
accounted for the development of new species. Many of the examples that are
often quoted as demonstrating that this is the main source of new species show
that new species have arisen in new niches, e.g. by geographic isolation as in
the case of the Galapagos Island tortoises and finches. But this evidence, by
itself, does not establish what the mechanism may have been. Other
interpretations would also be possible.

Darwin's idea of natural selection was in part based on observing the effects
of artificial selection, producing many different varieties of dogs, cats,
fish, etc. But it is important to note that thousands of years of this kind of
selection has produced new varieties, not fully fledged new species as defined
by inability to interbreed. At best, this demonstrates selection's ability to
produce incipient development of new species.

One of the best examples of species development is the variety of birds called
greenish warblers, forming what is called a ring species around the Himalayas
(Figure 8.1).

![](../Images/17624fig8_1.png)

Figure 8.1

Presumed evolution of greenish warblers around the Himalayas. The colours
indicate the subspecies: yellow: P. t. trochiloides; orange: P. t. obscuratus;
red: P. t. plumbeitarsus; green: P. t. ‘ludlowi’; blue: P. t. viridanus
(<https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Greenish_warbler_ring.svg>; Public
Domain).

North of the Himalayas there are two varieties (subspecies?) shown as blue and
red in Figure 8.1 that co-exist but do not interbreed. But they are each
connected to varieties with which they do interbreed, stretching around the
Himalayas to join the ring together in the south. Claud Ticehurst proposed in
1938 that the greenish warblers started in the south, then slowly evolved as
they spread around the Himalayas to the west and east, to eventually meet in
the north when they had become different species.34 Very recent genome studies
have shown that ‘although spatial patterns of genetic variation are currently
mostly as expected of a ring species, historical breaks in gene flow have
existed at more than one location around the ring, and the two Siberian forms
have occasionally interbred’.35

This is perhaps the best example we have of this process, which itself is
rare.36 The new evidence supports and extends Ticehurst's hypothesis about the
historical development, since the two northern forms are the most distinct
genetically, but it does not in itself prove the precise mechanism. It does
not, for example, exclude an influence of the environment on the selection of
combinations of genes, or any other process by which a Lamarckian process
becomes assimilated into the genome via environmental influence on epigenetic
variation. Nor does it exclude natural genetic engineering. This is a
difficulty with any study of existing genetic variations to infer the process
by which those variations originally arose.

It is important to emphasise that the assumption that genetic variations
responsible for the origin of species are independent of the organism and its
environment is just that: an assumption. It has not been proven experimentally
to produce new species. By contrast, hybridisation in plants readily generates
new species, and the process of symbiogenesis must also have done so,
particularly when eukaryotes evolved from prokaryotes. Natural genetic
engineering could also do so if it involves DNA shuffling that removes
reproductive compatibility.

The important message here is not that the generation of new species by
natural selection working on random mutations is impossible, but rather that
the examples often quoted to prove that it happened are not so clear-cut when
they are examined closely. We have to distinguish evidence about the
historical development of new species from evidence about the precise
mechanisms by which this happened. Moreover, as emphasised earlier in this
chapter, the different mechanisms might be so intertwined that it may be
inappropriate to think in terms of single mechanisms.

Can we obtain evidence from genetic and epigenetic data that such processes
involving both epigenetic variation and genetic assimilation may have
occurred? Experiments to answer this question were performed very recently.
Without doubt, the original icons of Darwinian evolution are the tortoises and
finches of the Galapagos Islands, the organisms that inspired Darwin's work
following his voyage on The Beagle. Darwin would not have been able to know
what caused the variations, but we can now begin to do so.

Michael Skinner's research team in the USA has studied the epi-genetic and
genetic variations in these finches.37 Figure 8.2 summarises the results of
their work in terms of the number of genetic (blue) and epigenetic (red)
variations (mutations) in four of the various finch species compared to the
reference species, Geospiza fortis. The results are consistent with the view
that both epigenetic and genetic variation have occurred and that the number
of both kinds of mutations increases with the presumed evolutionary distance
between the species. The smallest numbers, 84 epimutations and 34 genetic
mutations, are found between the closest species, while the largest, 1062
epimutations and 602 genetic mutations, are found between the most distant
species. Moreover, epigenetic changes in DNA methylation correlated better
with evolutionary distance than DNA sequence changes, and many of the
epigenetic changes clustered around genes involved in bone morphogenesis.

![](../Images/17624fig8_2.png)

Figure 8.2

Genetic and epigenetic variation in the finches of the Galapagos Islands. The
tree diagram on the left shows the relatedness of the 14 individual species.
Four of these species were compared with the one chosen as the reference
species, Geospiza fortis. DMR = DNA methylation region; CNV = copy number
variation. The number of epigenetic mutations is shown as red, the number of
genetic mutations in blue (from Skinner et al. 2014).38

This is what we might expect if the initial variation in beak formation had
been epigenetic followed by genetic assimilation, or more likely the
epigenetic and genetic changes simply intertwined rather than occurring
sequentially. As Skinner and his team conclude, ‘epigenetic and genetic
changes may jointly regulate genome activity and evolution, as recent
evolutionary biology modeling suggests’. What is clear from these studies is
that automatically assuming genetic mutation as the sole driver of
evolutionary change is no longer secure as an explanation. Genes as DNA
sequences may also be followers rather than drivers. That would match well
with what happens in all cells: the cell networks tell the genome what to do,
not the other way round.39

### Are Genes Followers Rather than Leaders?

How does Neo-Darwinism respond to this kind of explanation? The answers
usually illustrate the confusion that we found in [Chapter 5](book-
part5.html#CT-bp-5) over the definition and nature of genes. Consider the
response to the question raised in an article on genes as followers in the New
Scientist (12 October 2013) which quotes Richard Dawkins: ‘which elements have
the property that variations in them are replicated with the type of fidelity
that potentially carries them through an indefinitely large number of
evolutionary generations?’. Dawkins answers his own question: ‘Genes certainly
meet the criterion. If anything else does, let's hear it.’40 But he doesn't
clarify which definition of a gene he is using. If such an answer refers to
DNA sequences, as I suspect it does in this case, then it is clearly true that
much more is inherited. Moreover, as we have seen, DNA is not the only
replicator. Cells also replicate, and it is only through their replication via
self-templating that DNA can replicate. The two, DNA and the rest of the cell,
always and must replicate together. The famed ‘immortality’ of DNA is actually
a property of cells. Only cells have the machinery to correct the frequent
faults that occur in DNA replication.

There is a common misunderstanding of what counts as experimental evidence for
Neo-Darwinism. Evidence for evolutionary change and for speciation is now so
extensive as to be virtually incontrovertible. It is often taken to be
evidence for Neo-Darwinism as a specific theory of how it all happened. But
that evidence is perfectly consistent with other mechanisms outside the
standard framework of Neo-Darwinism.

Given the extent to which genomic reorganisation has occurred during
evolution, which was the subject of [Chapter 7](book-part7.html#CT-bp-7), and
the extent to which the genome is controlled by epigenetic mechanisms, which
can in turn be assimilated into the genome, it makes much more sense to see
the biological network processes as the driver. The genes, defined as
sequences of DNA, dance to the tune of evolution, to the tune of life itself.

### Isn't a Lot of DNA ‘Selfish’, ‘Parasitic’?

One of the standard defences of selfish gene theory is based on the discovery
that, in humans and many other organisms, only a few per cent of the genome
codes for proteins and can therefore be classified as ‘genes’ in the original
molecular biological sense. The rest was described as ‘junk’ DNA, the ultimate
example of ‘selfishness’ since it was seen as DNA ‘hitching a ride’ with no
function, a bit like a virus that has become permanently resident in the body.
The strong implication is that this discovery favours the selfish gene view.

We now know that is a confusing way of viewing genomes. There are several ways
in which the confusion can be unravelled.

The words ‘selfish’, ‘junk’, etc. are, of course, metaphors. More importantly
they are empirically empty metaphors when applied to sequences of DNA. No
conceivable experiment could validate or invalidate them, as explained in
[Chapter 5](book-part5.html#CT-bp-5). That the metaphors are empty from the
standpoint of empirical science does not mean they have no impact. On the
contrary, they have had, and still have, very persuasive impact on the way in
which many people think about biology.

A more persuasive counter-argument is therefore needed. Recent experimental
work has provided us with precisely that. The more we examine non-protein-
coding DNA the more evidence we find that an overwhelming 80% is transcribed
to form RNAs, and that around 20% of those are already known to have
function.41 It was far too premature to dismiss the great majority of the
human genome as junk.42

This also raises questions about what precisely is a gene. In the original
sense defined by Johanssen in 1909 (see [Chapter 5](book-part5.html#CT-bp-5))
a gene is anything that contributes to inheritance. At the least, therefore,
all the DNA that does that should be regarded as genes. It is too restrictive
to define ‘gene’ as only protein-coding DNA. On a relativistic view we should,
however, go even further than that. As we have seen from Waddington's and
other experiments, the whole pattern of the genome is relevant to inheritance.
The real problem with the gene-centred view is that it ignores the properties
of the genome as a whole. These overall patterns may have functional
significance through the eyes of a higher-level analysis at which functional
organisation and processes appear.

### The Speed of Evolution

Some of the problems in evolutionary theory concern the speed of speciation.
It is clear from the geological record that this has not always been smooth.
One of the reasons why Cuvier disagreed with Lamarck in the early nineteenth
century is that he was able to discredit Lamarck's idea of the transformation
of species by pointing to the fact that the fossil evidence, as it was known
then, was also consistent with multiple periods of creation. The record was
that patchy, and it was also clear that some species remained essentially
unchanged for very long periods of time, a phenomenon we call stasis. In the
twentieth century, with much more evidence to consider, Niles Eldredge and
Stephen Jay Gould in 1971 proposed the theory of punctuated equilibrium to
account for the fact that most fossil species show long periods of stasis, and
that rapid (on a geological time scale) changes occurred more rarely and were
important periods of speciation.43 The difference between their theory and
that of Cuvier was that Eldredge and Gould were simply proposing that
evolutionary change from a common ancestor does not happen at a constant
speed, whereas Cuvier interpreted the evidence to show that there had been
multiple creations.

Darwin also realised that evolutionary change could not always have been
smooth. In the fourth edition of The Origin of Species he wrote ‘the periods
during which species have undergone modification, though long as measured in
years, have probably been short in comparison with the periods during which
they retain the same form’. This is, in essence, Eldredge and Gould's idea of
punctuated equilibrium.

There has been much argument about what precisely is meant by ‘punctuated’. A
gradual change over 100,000, one million or even a few million years will
appear rapid on a geological time scale of hundreds of millions of years. The
Cambrian explosion that occurred over 500 million years ago is a good example.
Within just 20 million years all the phyla in existence today had developed.
The standard response to theories of punctuated evolution has therefore been
that they are entirely consistent with Neo-Darwinism. Changes in selection
pressure due to environmental changes or geographic distribution, and the
occasional catastrophic environmental change, might account for the observed
variations in speed of change without supposing additional mechanisms of
change.

However, the new evidence from work on symbiogenesis, the various forms of
inheritance of acquired characteristics, genetic assimilation, natural genetic
engineering, including genome change and reorganisation over and above the
accumulation of chance mutations, changes the situation in more fundamental
ways. These mechanisms resemble punctuated equilibrium theories in proposing
that evolution can occur in jumps. Since these can be very sudden indeed it is
best to use a word different from ‘punctuated’ to avoid confusion with
Eldredge and Gould's theory. ‘Saltatory’ means jumping. The new mechanisms
produce saltations of various kinds.

Symbiogenesis is the fusion of two species. The best established example of
this is the bacterial origin of mitochondria and plastids and, perhaps, other
organelles.44 Clearly, this process is the ultimate in ‘saltation’. It depends
on processes of cellular ingestion that are natural in the feeding activity of
unicellular organisms and, on an evolutionary time scale, it is therefore very
rapid indeed. Of course, subsequent changes can then also occur more slowly.
We know, for example, that some of the ingested DNA in what became organelles
eventually moved to the nucleus in eukaryotes.

Natural genetic engineering could also occur within a single generation.
Reorganisations of genomes involving duplications, deletions and insertions of
long sequences would be essentially instantaneous on a geological time scale.
Defenders of the Modern Synthesis have argued that speciation due to such
changes, and symbiogenesis, should not be classified as punctuated
equilibrium. That is correct in the sense that it was not what Eldridge and
Gould had in mind. But as far as time scale is concerned such changes would be
saltatory in the ordinary sense of the word. They would be even more sudden
than the punctuations proposed by Eldredge and Gould.

Genetic assimilation can also occur rapidly. Waddington's mid-twentieth-
century experiments showed that an induced acquired characteristic in fruit
flies could become permanent (assimilated) within 14 generations. This must
have represented the time required for selection for an induced characteristic
to bring together in a single genome all the relevant alleles for that
characteristic to be passed on to subsequent generations without the inducing
environmental stimulus.

Inheritance of acquired characteristics through the persistence of epigenetic
effects through successive generations can also speed up the evolutionary
process. These trans-generational environmental influences should spread
through a population much more rapidly since it is possible for a large
fraction of the population to be subject to the same changes at the same time.
There is no need to wait for a single DNA change to spread slowly through a
population. The orthodox response to this mechanism is to dismiss it as
transient, which it certainly is in some cases. But, as we have now seen,
there are examples of such transmission over many generations and which show
the same degree of strength as standard genetic transmission. Since such
effects would not need to occur very frequently, the difficulty in identifying
them experimentally would be perfectly understandable. Speciation itself is a
rare event.

While there can be considerable uncertainty about the relative contributions
of the different mechanisms to evolutionary change, two conclusions seem
clear. The first is that, with a variety of mechanisms open to the
evolutionary process, it should occur faster. The second is that it is
probable that the relative contributions varied at different stages in
evolution, and must often have interacted with each other. A systems
perspective on this opens up many possibilities for a general explanation of
sudden radiations, such as occurred during the Cambrian explosion.45

### Respecting the Principle of Biological Relativity

This chapter and the previous one have revealed the extraordinary range of
counterexamples to the processes assumed in Neo-Darwinism to be sufficient to
explain biological evolution. The molecular ‘single gene’ level is not the
most appropriate scale at which to look for all those processes. Many of them
depend on the pattern of gene variants and how they come together in
individual organisms. Evolution by changing that pattern doesn't even require
new mutations. Nor do epigenetic mechanisms. The single process of gradual
accumulation of small mutations followed by natural selection is clearly
inadequate as the basis of a comprehensive theory.

Respecting the principle of Biological Relativity requires that we take
account of mechanisms discovered at all scales and their interactions. That is
the subject of the last section of this chapter.

### A Biological Relativistic View of Evolution

It has been recognised for many years that the original formulation of Neo-
Darwinism needed extending. As we saw in [Chapter 5](book-part5.html#CT-bp-5),
it was already extended as early as 1931 by the addition of random genetic
drift46 and later in 1968 with Motoo Kimura's Neutral Theory of Molecular
Evolution,47 which can be seen as a development of random genetic drift. These
extensions recognised the need to take account of processes that could produce
variation and evolutionary change based on random selection within the
existing gene pool in a population, which can occur even without new
mutations. In this respect, they partly resemble both the adaptability driver
and Waddington's genetic assimilation process described earlier in this
chapter. Both of those also depend on change of combinations within the
existing gene pool without requiring new mutations.

The difference is that both the adaptability driver and Waddington's genetic
assimilation describe processes that are not really consistent with the spirit
of Neo-Darwinism. The adaptability driver gives to organisms the creative
initiative to choose and even help to create new niches. The driver, then, is
clearly the active phenotype, not the passive genotype. Genetic assimilation
is even more incompatible since it is a form of inheritance of acquired
characteristics. That is the reason why Waddington did not accept the Neo-
Darwinist view of evolution. The inheritance of acquired characteristics is
more than an extension. It is a complete break.

Further extensions were introduced more recently with the realisation that
strict separation between evolution and development was incorrect. This is the
central feature of an important book published in 2010 entitled Evolution: The
Extended Synthesis.48 That book contains many details on the experimental
results that lead to an extended evolutionary synthesis (EES). Figure 8.3
shows that these include around eight extensions.

![](../Images/17624fig8_3.png)

Figure 8.3

Extended evolutionary synthesis. The inner circle represents the main features
of Darwinism. The inner oval represents the processes added by Neo-Darwinism.
The outer oval represents the processes added in the extended evolutionary
synthesis proposed by Pigliucci and Müller in 2010. I have represented three
of these in bold face in anticipation of the view shown in Figure 8.4. This
diagram is based on Pigliucci and Müller's diagram. Adapted from: Pigliucci,
Massimo, and Gerd B. Müller, eds., Evolution, the Extended Synthesis, [Figure
1.1](book-part1.html#FIG-fig-1), p. 11, © 2010 Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, by permission of The MIT Press.

The inner circle of Darwinism includes variation, inheritance and natural
selection. Neo-Darwinism adds the processes of gene mutation, Mendelian
inheritance, population genetics, contingency and speciation.

The extended evolutionary synthesis is then viewed as adding evolutionary
developmental biology (evo-devo theory), genetic assimilation (plasticity and
accommodation), the adaptability driver and related effects (such as niche
construction), which we have already described in this chapter. To these are
added five more. Three of these, epigenetic inheritance, genomic evolution
(which includes natural genetic engineering described in the [previous
chapter](book-part7.html#CT-bp-7)) and multi-level selection (which naturally
respects the principle of Biological Relativity), we have already discussed.
The remaining ones are replicator theory and evolvability.

Evolvability refers to processes similar to those discussed in [Chapter
7](book-part7.html#CT-bp-7), which enable organisms to speed-up genetic
variation in response to environmental influences. As we saw in that chapter,
those effects can be very large and can be targeted functionally at the
relevant parts of the genome.

In addition to aspects of replication already discussed in this book,
replicator theory also refers to ways in which replication operates in other
fields, such as chemistry and neuroscience, that are beyond our scope.49

I think that the evidence and ideas discussed in this book oblige us to
represent the EES as a replacement because some of the features of Neo-
Darwinism that I described in [Chapter 5](book-part5.html#CT-bp-5) are
incompatible with what we now know. Science advances through the admission of
error. In fact it makes the biggest advances when it does that. We saw in
[Chapter 1](book-part1.html#CT-bp-1) how such admission of error was the
process by which the conceptual foundations of physics changed at the
beginning of the twentieth century. I believe we have reached such a tipping
point in biological science at the beginning of the twenty-first century.

Figure 8.4 illustrates the definitions and relationships between the various
features of Darwinism, the Modern Synthesis and a proposed new integrative and
relativistic synthesis. The diagram is based on an extension of the diagram
used by Pigliucci and Müller (Figure 8.3) in explaining the idea of an EES. It
can be considered as an extension of the extension to bring out the extent to
which it is actually a replacement.51 The main difference between Figure 8.3
and Figure 8.4 lies in the listing, at the left-hand side of Figure 8.4, of
those tenets of the Modern Synthesis that have now become impossible to
sustain.

![](../Images/17624fig8_4.png)

Figure 8.4

Diagram illustrating definitions of Darwinism, Modern Synthesis (Neo-
Darwinism) and Integrated Synthesis. The diagram is derived from Pigliucci and
Müller's (2010) presentation of an Extended Synthesis, shown in Figure 8.3.
All the elements are also present in their diagram. The differences are: (1)
the elements that are incompatible with the Modern Synthesis are shown in bold
on the right (as they also are in Figure 8.3); (2) the reasons for the
incompatibility are shown in the three corresponding bold elements on the
left. These three assumptions of the Modern Synthesis lie beyond the range of
what needs to extend or replace the Modern Synthesis; (3) in consequence, the
Modern Synthesis is shown as an oval extending outside the range of the
Extended Synthesis, which therefore becomes a replacement (from Noble 2015).50

The shift to a new synthesis in evolutionary biology can also be seen to be
part of a more general shift of viewpoint within biology towards systems
approaches. The reductionist approach (which inspired the Modern Synthesis as
a gene-centred theory of evolution) has been very productive, but it needs,
and has always needed, to be complemented by an integrative approach that
recognises causality at multiple levels. The reductionist interpretations of
evolution are not wrong in the sense that the processes they include do not
occur, they are simply incomplete.

In retrospect, Neo-Darwinism can therefore be seen to have oversimplified
biology and over-reached itself in its rhetoric. By so conclusively excluding
anything that might be interpreted as Lamarckism, it assumed what couldn't be
proved. As John Maynard Smith admitted in 1998, ‘it [Lamarckism] is not so
obviously false as is sometimes made out’,52 a statement that is all the more
significant from being made by someone working entirely within the Neo-
Darwinist framework. His qualification of this statement in 1998 was that he
couldn't see what the mechanism(s) might be. We can now do so thanks to the
ingenious experimental research in recent years, which I have described in
this and the [previous chapter](book-part7.html#CT-bp-7).

Nevertheless, the dogmatism was unnecessary and uncalled for. It damaged the
reputation of Lamarck, possibly irretrievably. He was caricatured as a figure
of fun. How could he be so silly as to suppose the impossible?! In fact,
Lamarck should be recognised by biologists generally as one of the very first
to coin and use the term ‘biology’ to distinguish our science, and by
evolutionary biologists in particular for championing the transformation of
species against some very powerful critics. Darwin praised Lamarck for this
achievement: ‘this justly celebrated naturalist…who upholds the doctrine that
all species, including man, are descended from other species’.

Many others were damaged too, Waddington included. Waddington was a systems
biologist in the full sense of the word. If we had followed his lead, many of
the more naive twentieth-century popularisations of genetics and evolutionary
biology could have been avoided. A little more humility in recognising the
pitfalls that beset the unwary when they think they can ignore some basic
philosophical principles would have been a wiser strategy. The great physicist
Poincaré pointed out, in connection with the relativity principle in physics,
that the worst philosophical errors are made by those who claim they are not
philosophers. They do so because they don't even recognise the existence of
the conceptual holes they fall into. Biology has its own version of those
conceptual holes.

### Conclusions

The principle of Biological Relativity has applications everywhere in biology,
but there can't be much doubt that the most surprising and fundamental
applications are in the field of evolutionary biology. For primarily
conceptual reasons, the subject has been dominated for a whole century by a
theory that made unjustifiable assumptions about what is possible in nature.
Recent experimental evidence in a wide range of fields, discussed in this
chapter and the previous one, have shown the need for change. But it is also
true that some significant features of the new evidence were foreshadowed in
work done half a century ago. Conrad Waddington led the way and should not
have been ignored. So did Barbara McClintock and Lynn Margulis.

The general reader might well ask why this has taken so long when the
conceptual and experimental arguments in favour of change are so convincing.
Why are scientists like me apparently in such a small minority? There is a
simple answer to that question. We are only apparently a minority.53 I have
discussed extensively with evolutionary and other biologists in the course of
lecturing to audiences, large and small, all around the world. Exceedingly few
of the tens of thousands involved have seriously defended the orthodox Neo-
Darwinist view as a complete explanation. The more usual reaction of many
biologists is ‘we have known most of this for a long time’, usually combined
with fairly vague notions of how restrictive the original assumptions of Neo-
Darwinism really are, and therefore with little understanding that Neo-
Darwinism is no longer valid as the sole explanation. The vagueness is also
widespread in the humanities and other sciences. The reason is that the
concepts have been presented in a sufficiently elastic way that almost any new
discovery can be made to seem compatible.54 Most significantly, many do not
realise that Darwin was not a Neo-Darwinist. They draw the uncomfortable
conclusion that to oppose Neo-Darwinism is to oppose the theory of evolution
itself. In fact, there are and always have been a number of theories on the
mechanisms by which evolution happened. None of them has been conclusively
shown to be the only mechanism.

So, I will finish this chapter with two important concluding reminders.

First, the evidence for evolutionary change and for the transformation of
species is overwhelming. Nothing in the new experimental results and arguments
for replacing Neo-Darwinist theory seriously challenges that evidence for
evolutionary change. On the contrary, this evidence reinforces the conclusion
that evolution has been the origin of species. The problem, as I have
explained in this and previous chapters, is that the evidence for evolutionary
change is consistent with, and requires, a more integrative theory that
acknowledges more mechanisms of variation than the random ones assumed by Neo-
Darwinism as the exclusive mechanisms.

Second, it was a central feature of Neo-Darwinism to conclusively exclude the
inheritance of acquired characteristics. That even became a dogma. Dogmas have
no role in science.

The view of evolution that I have developed in this book avoids that kind of
dogmatic certainty. I have outlined various possible mechanisms, some of which
are clearly outside the usual boundaries, and certainly outside the classical
boundaries, of Neo-Darwinism. I have also admitted that we simply do not know
which of these mechanisms contributed to or dominated evolutionary change at
the various stages. The starting point in science is to admit what we don't
know since that enables us to formulate the right questions. We can then
design experiments and empirical observations to distinguish between the
possible hypotheses.

The dance of the DNA sequences as they were first developed and then
controlled by living organisms occurred in a continually unfolding theatre
that has been performing for 3.5 billion years. That theatre has developed a
magnificent organ – the genome – but let's not confuse the organ with the
players and composers. They are life itself. The DNA nucleotides dance to
life's music like puppets on strings.

epigenetics. This is a mistake since the two kinds of epigenetic effects can
interact in evolutionary processes. I agree with Patrick Bateson in continuing

26 See Rob Martienssen: ‘It was actually Darwin who first realized this
potential. He was a big fan of Lamarck. A lot of people don't realize that,
but in The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication he wrote that
if Lamarckian Inheritance – the inheritance of acquired traits – was true,
then there must be some property arising in the body that could enter the germ
line and change the germ line for the next generation. And Darwin called these
gemmules – which is a wonderful name and we think small RNAs are very good
candidates for those gemmules.’ In The Evolution of Evolution: Darwin's
Gemmule Theory Revisited, <http://bigthink.com/in-their-own-words/the-
evolution-of-evolution-darwins-gemmule-theory-revisited>.

27 Baldwin, James (1896) A new factor in evolution. The American Naturalist
30:441–451. Many biologists today regard the Baldwin effect as perfectly
compatible with the Neo-Darwinian Modern Synthesis. This can be done by taking
a purely gene-centric view of what is happening. That viewpoint conceals the
fact that the process depends on an active choice of environment at the level
of the phenotype. Baldwin was a psychologist and described the phenomenon as
the effect of learned behaviour on evolution. The important point is that it
is organisms that choose to behave in a particular way, not genes. The active
role here occurs at the phenotype level. Genes then follow by the process of
assimilation. The Baldwin effect is as much an assimilation of a character
into the gene pool as Waddington's experiments were.

28 This is the term favoured by Patrick Bateson, who has carefully researched
the literature on the ‘Baldwin Effect’, see Bateson, P. (2006) The
adaptability driver: links between behavior and evolution. Biological Theory
1:342–345. He makes two points. First, that this process was first identified
by Douglas Spalding in 1873, so predating Baldwin. Second, that a behavioural
driver dependent on the adaptability of the phenotype could drive evolution
more rapidly in a direction that would be extremely unlikely to occur by
combinations of chance mutations. Both of these conclusions are convincing, so
I will use ‘adaptability driver’ instead of ‘Baldwin effect’ in this book.

29 The mechanisms by which animals make such choices is now an active field of
study, see Rubenstein at
[www.princeton.edu/eeb/people/display_person.xml?netid=dir](http://www.princeton.edu/eeb/people/display_person.xml?netid=dir).

30 This is a fundamental point. Just as in physics, where higher-level
thermodynamics can be well ordered while random movements occur at the
molecular level, so in biology apparent randomness at one level (e.g. genes as
DNA sequences) does not guarantee randomness at a higher functional level.

Baldwin was a psychologist. His starting point was human cultural behaviour.
It is not therefore surprising that he attributed the mechanism that carries
his name to an active choice of the organisms. Wozniak, R.H. (2001)

Baldwin. In J.M. Baldwin, Mental Development in the Child and the Race:

32 Textbooks and articles on the Modern Synthesis usually regard the ‘Baldwin
effect’ (adaptability driver) as compatible with Neo-Darwinism, a view that is
reinforced by the fact that Baldwin was arguing against the Neo-Lamarckians of
the late nineteenth century and allied himself with the first Neo-Darwinians.
As the Wikipedia entry on the Baldwin effect says, ‘it is generally recognised
as part of the modern evolutionary synthesis’. This can be true if one really
believes that it is only by chance that organisms display such adaptability.
But that is to assume already what is in question regarding Neo-Darwinism,
which is whether everything arises through blind chance. That seems to me to
be completely contrary to Spalding's and Baldwin's intention, which was to
highlight the role of active behavioural choice in organisms. This argument is
at the heart of the debate over the role of purpose in living systems.

there has also been considerable moving of the goal posts, with even the

Darwinism on some accounts. See exchange of views in Williams, C.A. (2015)

## 9 The Relativity of Epistemology

The Meaning of It All

Many humanist and religious authors…have drawn attention to its [Neo-
Darwinism's] damaging effects on man's spiritual life.

(Conrad Waddington, The Strategy of the Genes, 1957)

As we have seen in this book, Conrad Waddington was a great and innovative
biologist, strongly opposed to Neo-Darwinism. The quotation here might
nevertheless surprise you in his use of the word ‘spiritual’. He specifically
referred to non-religious as well as religious authors, so he was clearly not
using the word in a purely religious context. On the contrary, he viewed
ethics and other aspects of spirituality as a secular matter in the context of
evolutionary progress.1

From a scientific perspective I see spirituality, as I think Waddington did,
as purposive creativity, which is what I will usually call it. Such creativity
arises from purposive processes in organisms. To be sure, those processes have
a material base in the molecular components. But as you will have learnt from
this book, functional purpose at higher levels in organisms is precisely what
constrains those components to serve as its material base, while they still
follow the laws of physics and chemistry.

I don't think that scientific interpretation is widely appreciated,2 so this
chapter begins with another story from my own experience.

At an early stage in developing the ideas that led to this book I presented
some of my results using mathematical modelling of biological systems to a
meeting on the limits of reductionism in science chaired by the great
embryologist at University College London, Lewis Wolpert, himself a leading
and vocal reductionist.3 My talk concerned the necessity for integration to
complement reduction in biology. Out of the 25 or so participants, only one
openly supported my argument. I had expected at least two others, one of them
a very distinguished neuroscientist who confided in me during the coffee
break: ‘I would go along with you, Denis, except that what you are arguing
would let God back in.’ This was very revealing to me, since I certainly did
not think that conclusion followed at all. Yet he clearly did, and had no
doubt about it. In fact, I suspect that for many scientists, defending
reductionism, including particularly Neo-Darwinism, was a necessity in order
to counter the claims of creationist religions or supernatural intelligent
design. I think they are throwing out the baby with the bathwater. The baby is
what it is to be human, including creative purpose; the bathwater is the murky
deep water where the philosophical distinctions between science and
creationist religion might be found.

This chapter addresses the question of whether they are right to do so. Is
there a scientific perspective on what it is to be human?

### Why? Questions and Goals

Perhaps the biggest ‘why?’ questions of all are why we are here and why the
universe is as it is. These are the questions with which this book began.

Public debate on these questions has become so polarised that it may seem that
there are only two kinds of answer to that question. On one side are some (but
by no means all) of the world's religions, attributing meaning to a creator
that designed the universe and gave it purpose. I wrote ‘that’ rather than
‘who’ since ‘who’ would restrict the idea to a creator conceived in our image
as a person. ‘That’ leaves the question open to include intelligent design,
whether or not one ascribes personhood to the process by which the
‘intelligence’ operates. Either way, what are intended here are entities that
are beyond what empirical science can know about. We can view that as a
definition of what is meant. Metaphysics of this kind really is ‘beyond’
physics and so beyond what we can investigate.

On the other side are the reductionist interpretations of evolutionary biology
as it developed during the twentieth century. Those interpretations involve
the idea that every variation arises as a consequence of blind chance followed
by selection amongst the variants. Blind chance is seen here as the ‘real’
underlying nature of the universe. That view is supported by the feeling that,
at the lowest scale, the fundamental particles cannot conceivably have goals
or intentions. But there is also a further assumption, which is usually
unspoken. This is that if the elements cannot have goals, then nothing else in
the universe can do so. There is no room in this interpretation for purpose.

By contrast with both of these extremes, ‘intelligence’ that we can
investigate and know about is in another category which we may call ‘natural
purposiveness’. We have encountered it several times in this book and I will
say more about it later in this chapter. Natural purposiveness is to human
purposiveness much as natural selection is to artificial (meaning human)
selection.

The phenomenon of having goals and purpose is called teleology. The
elimination of teleology takes various forms in reductionist accounts. One of
these is to represent teleological explanations as failing the test of being
parsimonious. A clear message of this book is that what is parsimonious at one
level is not necessarily so at other levels. When nature exhibits complexity
we should acknowledge that by moving to the level that is appropriate for a
successful explanation, which can then be purposive. I illustrated that idea
in [Chapter 3](book-part3.html#CT-bp-3), where we saw that, at the level of
molecules, it doesn't make sense to talk about heart rhythm. At the level of
cells it does. And at the level of the organism it becomes a perfectly good
hypothesis to identify the purpose of that rhythm.

The elimination of teleology is often presented as a virtue. In fact it is an
unnecessary restriction. It expresses the metaphysical view that teleology
should be avoided in scientific explanations. There is no experimental proof
of this assumption. The better and practical criterion is whether theories
that involve teleology satisfy the criterion of utility: do they lead to good
scientific experiments and explanations? William Harvey's seventeenth-century
experiments on the circulation of the blood were also experiments that
revealed the purpose of the heartbeat.

That discovery has had great utility in the subsequent physiological studies
of all functions of organisms with circulations. It led, for example, to the
search for how arterial and venous parts of the circulation are connected and
so to the discovery of capillaries. It is impossible for a physiologist to
discuss the roles of oxygen, carbon dioxide and nutrients that cells require
to survive without invoking the purpose of the circulation. All of the
molecules involved are constrained to do what they do by the cardiovascular
system as a whole. It is to this system that we can and should ascribe
purpose. And, incidentally, it makes much more sense to do this than to
ascribe a self to a sequence of DNA.

This is a question of what kinds of theory make sense at different levels. It
is only by focusing on the molecular level that we can possibly justify the
view that there is no purpose. It is an important consequence of the theory of
Biological Relativity that we should ascribe functions and purposes to the
level at which they make sense, which is the level at which they constrain the
interactions of the system at lower levels. This constraint is also what
canalises those interactions to serve the natural purposiveness of organisms.
Notice also that I switched to talking about levels rather than scales. As
explained in [Chapter 2](book-part2.html#CT-bp-2), levels and scales are not
the same. A level, which must occur at some scale or other, is defined by the
organisation that is to be found at that level.

### The Third Way4

As we have seen in the [previous chapters](book-part8.html#CT-bp-8), there is
a ‘third way’. Blind chance is not the only way in which evolutionary
variation occurs. Changes in DNA can be responsive to the environment within
the organism itself, and to the organism's environment. These in turn have
depended on the activity of previous organisms since, in response to such
influences, organisms have rearranged genomes during the course of evolution.
Changes in the organism in response to the environment can be inherited. DNA
is not therefore ‘sealed off from the outside world’ nor did it ‘create us
body and mind’.5 On the contrary ‘Nature is even more wondrous than the
architects of the Modern Synthesis thought, and involves processes we thought
were impossible’.6 We are still absorbing the immense implications of these
developments in biology, and many other disciplines. Whole areas of economics,
sociology and philosophy are based on interpretations of selfish gene
viewpoints. No field of human endeavour will remain untouched since the
implications affect even our concept of humanity.

Is it necessary that science and humanity should be in opposition? Creative
purposiveness is the human characteristic that is most often ‘explained away’
by reductionists. Yet it is the very essence of our art, music, sport, poetry
and writing, which all obviously depend on this aspect of our humanity.
Science itself is also one of the greatest expressions of creativity. It is
not, or should not be, a merely mechanical accumulation of data without
interpretation. The activity of interpretation requires creativity. So why
does the naive reductionist view have so much difficulty with it? What is the
problem?

### Science and Humanity

The problem can be illustrated using the story with which I opened this
chapter. Can it be correct to defend reductionism, including Neo-Darwinism in
particular, as a necessity in order to counter the claims of creationist
religions or supernatural intelligent design? Isn't this the wrong way to
defend reductionism in science? We need the reductionist approach, provided
that it is complemented by its natural and necessary companion, integration.
We should not let this necessity be hidden behind fears of misinterpretation
by creationists.

It is the wrong way also because, in its dogmatism, it makes reductionism
itself into a form of religion, in the general sense of requiring faith, not
proof. There is nothing in the scientific method that justifies the view that
there is only one way to study Nature. To represent science as necessarily and
uniquely reductionist is therefore an article of faith. That is even more
obviously true today when, as we have seen in [previous chapters](book-
part8.html#CT-bp-8) of this book, the Neo-Darwinist theory is clearly
incomplete. It is therefore a paradox of the Neo-Darwinist and creationist
debates that the dogmatic forms of both sides start from a position of faith.
It is in this context that we can understand why many prominent Neo-Darwinists
are also prominent atheists. That also is a statement of faith. Part of that
statement of faith is that creative purpose, consciousness and intentionality
are all mirages, epiphenomena without significance or effect. This leads to
the idea that our actions are mechanically determined by our brains and,
ultimately, by our genes. Not surprisingly, many non-scientists, and indeed
many scientists also, do not think this could be anything like an adequate
representation of what we know and see within and around us. The purely
mechanistic view of life doesn't resonate with common sense knowledge of
ourselves and of many other species.

### Science and Common Sense

Many would say so much the worse for common sense. Common sense, after all,
has often been wrong and it is science that has usually revealed where it goes
wrong. As we saw in [Chapter 1](book-part1.html#CT-bp-1), common sense was
wrong about the centre of the universe, and it was certainly surprised, even
shocked, by the indeterminacy, apparent or real, of quantum mechanics. Common
sense can even confuse scientists. The French philosopher August Comte
famously said in 1835 that we could never know the chemistry of the stars.7
Yet we now know so much from studying the spectroscopy of starlight that we
have come to understand that we ourselves are stardust, as are all the atoms
on Earth, since in the hot cauldron of stars is where atoms were formed. Comte
would have needed to know about the surprising findings that led to quantum
mechanics to avoid his mistake, since it is the quantal energy jumps of
electrons in atoms that enable the light spectrum to reveal which atoms and
molecules are present. This would have been inconceivable prior to the
revolution in physics created by quantum mechanics. Comte would have thought
that all starlight was much the same.

As another example, in 1895 the British scientist Lord Kelvin stated that it
would be impossible to build a machine heavier than air which could fly. Just
a few years later, the Wright brothers did just that with the first aeroplane
in 1903. In this case, it was the application of already understood physical
theory of air flow combined with clever engineering that achieved the
demonstration that it was possible. Even today, many of us feel that it
challenges common sense that a huge and heavy jumbo jet should be able to fly.
We feel that even when we also fully understand the aerodynamics of what is
happening.

It is important therefore to recognise that painstaking scientific
investigation and engineering creativity have often overturned common sense.
Much of our world today, with its wireless communications, internet, cloud
computing, travel to planets and much else, would look impossible to our
predecessors.

But we mustn't conclude from this history that science must always be right.
Sometimes the clash between science and common sense is a conceptual matter
that is not and cannot be settled by empirical enquiry alone. I can understand
perfectly well that the displaced paving stone that made me fall and hurt
myself is virtually empty at an atomic scale since its individual atoms are
mostly formed of empty space. But it was nevertheless hard and solid to me
when I tripped over it. The problem with this kind of clash is largely
semantic. In ordinary conversation it makes perfect sense to use the words
‘solid’ and ‘hard’ in the way we do, while also understanding that, at a micro
scale, there is mostly empty space. Hardness is a macro property, not
applicable to the ultra-micro level. This simple example illustrates the
influence of scales and levels on the way in which we explain things.
Explanations at one scale are not necessarily appropriate at other scales.
This is an important part of the relativity of epistemology to which I will
return later in this chapter.

The clash between a mechanical view of the universe, including living systems,
and a functionally purposive view is in this conceptual category. The purely
mechanistic view is itself a form of metaphysics. So can we find a criterion
for where ‘science’ might be wrong? That is surprisingly simple. Just ask
whether what we think is ‘science’ (notice the inverted commas) is really
hiding a statement of faith by making an assumption that cannot be justified
by experimental evidence. In the case of the clash between mechanical and
functionally purposive views of life, the unjustified assumption is that
organisms are closed, determinate systems, whereas in fact they are open
systems. It is that uncontroversial and well-established fact that leads to
the issue between blind mechanism and meaningful function being a conceptual
one. Demonstrating pure ‘blind’ mechanism at one level does not guarantee the
absence of function at a higher level.

This is a subtle but deeply significant philosophical point, usually ignored
by simplistic reductionism. We often think of factual and conceptual questions
as completely separate. That is also what I was taught as a student. Science
was interpreted to be simply interested in factual truth and could float free
of philosophy. But factual and conceptual questions necessarily interact. If
genomes really were ‘sealed off from the outside world’ the conceptual
questions about mechanistic and functional views of organisms would be quite
different. But as we have seen, the assumed ‘fact’ of being ‘sealed off’ is
simply not true. We are therefore forced to consider more subtle views of
organisms and of questions like ‘what is life?’. I say more subtle because
complexity is always more challenging, requiring more nuanced approaches, than
is simplicity. The nuanced approach required is that of scale-dependent
theory. As we learnt in [Chapter 6](book-part6.html#CT-bp-6), that can be
quite as rigorous, quite as mathematically precise, as simple reductionism. It
just requires that many more factors and forms of causation be taken into
account and that we understand the principle of Biological Relativity.

Returning to the views of creationists, it doesn't get us very far to answer
their theist position with what amounts to an alternative statement of faith.
Some thoughtful theists have long realised this fact and, whether or not you
agree with their theism, they are often better philosophers than their naive
attackers. In common with many other scientists, I feel embarrassed by the
lack of basic philosophical awareness in much of what is written on this
matter on behalf of ‘science’. Whether the authors know it or not, they are in
fact speaking not on behalf of science but rather on behalf of an alternative
metaphysical viewpoint, and often enough they do not appreciate the need for
humility in the face of the deep uncertainties. To claim to speak to the
general public with ‘scientific’ authority about the deepest ‘why’ questions
with a false certainty that cannot be justified simply creates problems, it
does not solve them.

### Is Naive Theism the Only Alternative?

Moreover, naive theism is not the only religious answer to the biggest why
question. There have been, and still are, major religions that do not require
belief in a creator. Even within the Christian and Jewish traditions there are
strands of thought that are closer to forms of agnosticism, and Buddhism is an
obvious example amongst oriental religions.8 There are many more. In earlier
centuries the first Christian missionaries to discover these religions in East
Asia needed to invent new words to convey the idea of God as creator of the
universe. The word ‘god’ in the languages of the region would not have
conveyed their message. It could just as easily have been the spirit of a
stone.

These religious traditions are very different from the naive theism usually
chosen as the object of attack by reductionist philosophers and scientists.
Those traditions are more concerned with spirituality and practice than with
belief. In the case of Buddhism, the founder even counselled against bothering
much over belief when there was the much more practical question of
alleviating suffering to deal with. This is the point of the parable of the
poisoned arrow: rather than bother with who fired the arrow, just remove it
and treat the wound.9

Moreover, in contrast to the difficulties in knowing what a God could or might
be, there is nothing mysterious about creative purposiveness in the scientific
sense in which I am using the term here. Once we recognise that life and
living organisms have purpose, the very possession of goal-directed behaviour
is to express creativity, in its various social forms.

So why should anyone think that this all ‘lets God back in’? I suspect that
those who think this way fear that to acknowledge creative purposiveness
implies spirituality, which in turn is seen only in a religious context. To
return to the quotation at the beginning of this chapter, I think that this
arises because we no longer use the word ‘spirituality’ in the natural
scientific context in which Waddington used it. Yet this is its original
meaning!

The word spirit comes from the Latin word ‘spiritus’, meaning breath, one of
the obvious processes of life in higher organisms. Many spiritual traditions
involving meditation focus on the breath. Breathing is a vital process in us.
Life itself is also a process, as we have seen in [previous chapters](book-
part8.html#CT-bp-8). Life processes are spiritual in the relevant sense that
they are not purely material. It is easy to show this. At the moment of death
it is the processes of life that will cease. The molecules will remain, but no
longer constrained by a living system. What therefore leaves the body at that
point is not a material thing. Nor is it a ghostly ‘something other’. If by
‘spiritual’ we mean non-material then this is its most natural scientific
meaning. In this sense the mind is also spiritual. The mind is not my brain.
It is not a material substance. It requires the brain, and indeed the rest of
my body, to function. But to say that something is necessary is not to say
that it is necessarily sufficient. It is a conceptual mistake to equate the
mind with just a part of the body.10

These interpretations of mind–body relations enable us also to return to the
difficult question of the vital force, or oriental equivalents such as the
Chinese qi. The obvious interpretation using the conclusions of this book is
that vital force simply consists in the processes of life. These processes
express the creativity of living organisms. In many, or even all, organisms
they also include social interactions with other organisms and with the
physical environment. They express the essential openness of living organisms.
This openness and the interactions with other organisms is the condition for
creativity.

My reading of Lamarck's great work, Philosophie Zoologique, also suggests this
interpretation of ‘le pouvoir de la vie’, usually translated into English as
‘life force’ and so often mistaken for a form of vitalism. On the contrary,
Lamarck was firmly a materialist. Any complexity in living organisms had to
originate from physical interactions. Some of his ideas on complexity would be
consistent with modern systems thinking.11

### Contextual Logic

An essential property of living processes therefore is their sensitivity to
the logic of their context. Organisms with purpose act from reasons not just
through causes. Reasons and causes are not the same. Of course, there are
required neural, muscular, hormonal and other bodily causes of our actions,
but in open systems these necessarily mesh with the processes occurring in the
environment. Some of these processes are accidental, such as avalanches,
storms and other events that we often call ‘acts of god’, and they include
mechanical failure of man-made systems, and many others besides. But in the
case of social interactions they are far from accidental. The reason for that
is that the goal-directedness of each organism interacts and meshes with that
of other organisms. The overall behaviour of the population then resembles
that of games that are rule-dependent rather than that of random physical
events. Games follow the contextual logic – the rules of the game and the
strategies of the players – as well as the physical constraints on what is
possible. This is how meaning enters into biological function.

Contextual social interaction to produce rule-dependent behaviour would be
impossible if one really believes that all actions of organisms are determined
solely by neural activity in the brain and elsewhere in the body since, on the
contrary, some of those events are constrained by the contextual logic. This
is yet another example of reductionism representing causality the wrong way
round. The way out of the conceptual block of reductionism is to remember that
organisms are stochastic and they are open systems. The stochasticity confers
flexibility to produce a variable rather than a determinate phenotype, while
it is the interactions with the environment, including other organisms, that
enables each organism to display rule-guided behaviour. Living organisms exist
at the interface between the stochasticity of their molecular processes and
the rule (or reason) dependent interaction with their environment.

Consider what I am doing at the moment. Writing a book (or indeed any other
creative endeavour) is one of the supreme examples of the consequences of
organisms being open systems existing at such an interface. It is a purposive
activity in response to all the reasons that lie in the context in which the
book is conceived. Without knowledge of that context and its logic, analysis
of the trillions of nerve discharges in my brain would get you nowhere. The
only way to make sense of what I am doing at the moment is to see it as a
meshing of my neural activity with that context, including the purposive
behaviour of other organisms. My neurons are necessarily constrained by those
meaningful interactions. Therefore the useful answer to the question of what I
am doing is: ‘I am writing a book.’ I can then explain the reasons, and
significantly those will not usually include or be restricted to physical
mechanical events. An answer that details my neural activity will be of
interest to a neuroscientist, but it will not and cannot answer the question.
Nor would it naturally lead to those reasons. To say therefore that those
neural events are all that is happening is to ignore precisely what is
purposive about such activity.

The reductionist reply to this kind of argument is to quote the important
neurophysiological experiments of the American scientist Benjamin Libet. In
1983 he showed that it was possible to record activity in the brain when a
human subject was executing a voluntary action like pressing a button. The
important observation was that such neural activity can occur before the
subject notices that he has decided to make the movement.12 The reductionist
interpretation of the experiment is that the appearance of freely choosing to
make the action is just that, an appearance not a reality, since the brain
‘acted’ before the subject had the awareness of doing so. If one considers the
brain to be a purely mechanical closed system, this must surely mean that the
subject was forced by his brain to make the choice.

There are in fact many possible interpretations of the experiment, which turns
out not to be as clear-cut as originally thought. The one that is relevant to
this book is that we must take account of the social context in which the
subject is acting.13 He is told that he should choose when he wishes to make
his action. Is it surprising that this should result in build-up towards doing
so? This is the logical context in which the expectations of needing to act
interact with the neural states of the subject's brain. Those interactions are
going on all the time while writing this book. I experience various kinds of
impulse, to stop, to return, or not, to doing it. I have no doubt that I am
often on auto-pilot when pacing the garden, cooking a supper, playing the
guitar, reading a new article. Preparatory neural activity must be occurring
all the time. Yet my intention to write the book is always there. Intentions
that really matter in our lives are like that. They are not discrete single
events in the way in which the Libet experiment supposes. Moreover, we can be
certain that the words that eventually appear on the screen of my computer are
not in themselves anything other than the product of the meshing of my neural
and bodily activity with the complete contextual logic of my interactions with
all of those activities and the environmental influences on them, the latest
of which was re-reading Libet's 1983 and subsequent papers. As I read those
papers I also knew that he intended to write them and that they also arose
from just such a process of interactions with the contextual logic of his
situation.

To explain this kind of meshed interaction between internal and external
factors in a way that may help the reader, I will use an extension of the
diagram of Conrad Waddington that we used in [Chapter 6](book-part6.html#CT-
bp-6). Instead of genes at the lower level, we will have neuronal activity;
instead of the gene--phenotype networks we will have neural and hormonal
networks. Crucially, to those networks we now add network links to the
environment and to other organisms. These links were always implicit in
Waddington's idea, but we now make them explicit. As in his original diagram,
those lines of interactions are the means by which the networks constrain the
landscape, which now becomes a landscape of possible behaviour rather than a
landscape of development. This version of his diagram is also valid for
Waddington's original application of the diagram to genes and their
interactions through networks.

The landscape in this form of the diagram is shaped by the networks of
interactions in the environment as well as by networks within the organism.
Some of these interactions, including particularly those with other organisms,
will exhibit purpose since all organisms do that to varying degrees. The mesh
between those interactions and the goal-directed response within the organism
itself is what leads to rule-guided behaviour, which we can view as a social
interactions game. This is the most dramatic of the forms of downward or
contextual causation, because many of the outcomes will be impossible to
predict from knowledge of the single organism. It is dramatic also because
rule-guided behaviour is precisely behaviour for which there are reasons, not
just physical causes. Drama, of course, requires meaning. Meaning is a social
phenomenon (Figure 9.1).

Figure 9.1

Extension of Waddington's diagram to represent the open nature of organisms.
The bottom half of the illustration is the same as his original diagram,
already shown in [Chapter 6](book-part6.html#CT-bp-6) (from Waddington, 1957).
The upper half represents environmental influences. Both influence the
phenotype landscape. Unlike the networks in the bottom half, which link to
specific genes, the network of environmental influences opens up to an
indefinitely large set of interactions, which can only be hinted at in the
diagram by the lines disappearing at the top. Nothing in the environmental
networks corresponds to specific ‘genes’. A similar extension of Waddington's
diagram can be found in Bateson (2014).14

This may seem strange to someone who is locked-in to a purely mechanistic view
of living systems. How, they will ask, can a sequence of ‘blind’ physical
events come to embody a process that is driven by reasons, that follows rules,
including moral rules?

Yet it should not seem strange. The readers of this book almost certainly
possess machines that do this. Computers are, at the physical level,
deterministic machines. Yet, when they are following a logical program they
follow rules, i.e. the contextual logic formed by the program. Like living
organisms, modern computers are open systems that interact with us and with
their environment.

But wait a minute, you may say. That is so only because a human wrote the
program, not because the logical behaviour emerged from a purely physical
system. Precisely so. The openness of the computer as a machine is exactly
what enables its otherwise purely mechanical functions to be constrained by
the contextual logic derived from its interaction with humans. Even if you
wish to maintain that a human being is also a physical automaton, you would
have to grant that its openness also leads to its ‘programming’ by the social
interactions into which it enters. Together with stochasticity that is what
ensures that we end up not being purely mechanical machines. Otherwise, why
would I be writing this book? I do so because I have a reason to do so; to
convince you of the theory of Biological Relativity and its implications.
There is a vast contextual framework to writing this book. You, the reader,
will readily understand that. You do not need to examine the neurons in my
brain to do so.

The equivalent to the human writing a program for a computer is the
evolutionary process. Goal-directed behaviour has evolved. Creative evolution
‘wrote’ the ‘programs’ for the logic of living systems, but it did not do so
solely in the genome. Nor did it isolate the genome from itself and its
environment.

I put ‘wrote’ and ‘programs’ in inverted commas to warn us that we then no
longer need the program metaphor. The program becomes the process itself, not
a separate set of instructions.

### Selfish Genes and Altruism

A serious challenge to the Neo-Darwinist Modern Synthesis is how to account
for genuinely altruistic behaviour. A very limited form of altruism can be
derived from the idea that individual organisms might preserve their genes
through acting altruistically towards other members of their species who share
those genes. This is the approach that gave rise to kin-selection theory since
the organisms that would be most likely to share the same genes (strictly
speaking, the same gene variants) will be near relatives.15

It is of course true that close kin often act altruistically towards each
other. But there are nevertheless two obvious problems with this explanation.
The first is that it clearly doesn't explain altruistic behaviour towards
other organisms that are not closely related. The second and even more serious
problem is that it conflates the concepts of selfishness and altruism at
different levels. This is a mistake since selfish or altruistic behaviour at
one level does not automatically guarantee such behaviour at another level. A
selfish individual nevertheless relies on extensive co-operation between its
genes (and its proteins, lipids, etc.) in order for it to be even possible
that he or she might be selfish as a whole individual organism. Whether or not
our genes can be represented as selfish, it does not follow that ‘we are born
selfish’.16

It is instructive to compare the difficulty Neo-Darwinism has to explain
genuine altruism with the problem that faced Descartes three centuries ago.
Like the Neo-Darwinists, Descartes also imagined that it would be possible to
‘deduce the whole form and configuration’ of an organism from knowledge of
what was in the semen, as we saw in [Chapter 6](book-part6.html#CT-bp-6).
Descartes’ way out of the dilemma this causes in trying to explain human
behaviour was to suppose that the mind interacts with the body (through the
pineal gland) to enable the mind to control the body. Curiously, this is
exactly what some Neo-Darwinists take as their way out of the dilemma.
Consider this text from The Selfish Gene:

Let us try to teach generosity and altruism, because we are born selfish. Let
us understand what our own selfish genes are up to, because we may then at
least have the chance to upset their designs, something that no other species
has ever aspired to.17

The comparison with Descartes’ position is appropriate because Dawkins not
only supposes that we can ‘upset their designs’ but also that this is unique
to our species, as did Descartes. This is therefore Cartesian dualism, though
I imagine that it is unlikely that Neo-Darwinians would wish to acknowledge
that. The mysterious nature of the intervention is also a parallel. There is
no explanation of the process(es) by which the ‘upsetting’ may occur.

As we saw in [Chapter 6](book-part6.html#CT-bp-6), there is no mystery here.
Processes at higher levels in organisms naturally constrain the components at
lower levels through determining the boundary conditions within which those
components interact. We don't require overt or covert recourse to Cartesian
dualism. In open systems, it necessarily follows that analysis of behaviour at
a lower level will be incomplete in precisely the way in which differential
equations of motion are incomplete until the conditions necessary to integrate
the equations have been incorporated. This is a central aspect of the theory
of Biological Relativity.

### Relativity of Epistemology

In [Chapter 2](book-part2.html#CT-bp-2) we saw the immense differences in
scale that are relevant to living organisms. Just to repeat the main point, a
proton (a hydrogen ion) views a cell much as we view the universe. And that is
also how a single cell views us. Universes within universes within universes –
and beyond what we can see and know about, who knows?

‘Know’ is the right word here. We have no idea what, if anything, could lie
beyond what we see and observe. That should inspire humility. So, the first
step towards appreciating the relativity of epistemology is to acknowledge
that obvious fact. Note also that the Latin for ‘to know’, scire, is also the
basis of the word ‘science’, scientia. Necessarily, science is concerned with
what we can know.

Cosmologists have shown great insight in extrapolating from what we observe
now to how it may have begun and how it then developed. The big bang theory is
an immensely audacious achievement, making perhaps the best sense we can of
what is known at the present state of that knowledge. We can even detect the
radiation that may represent what remains from the earliest events, calculate
when stars began to form (‘let there be light’!), and how old the most distant
visible galaxies must be.18

So, I would like now to return to where this book began. What did our
ancestors think when they observed the extraordinary firmament above us on a
clear, moonless night? What now would be our answer to their big ‘why’
question?

They would be astonished to discover that neither the Earth nor the sun is the
centre of the universe, that there isn't a centre anyway, and that the
universe is vastly bigger and older than they could possibly have imagined.
After asking how we now know all of that and explaining the steps by which we
reached these conclusions, I can also imagine them scratching their heads.
Yes, they would say, that's all amazing and very interesting. But that still
doesn't answer our big ‘why’ question.

If they probed even deeper into what we don't know they would find further big
surprises. In fact the questions could be quite embarrassing. Let's imagine
the conversation:

‘You tell us the universe began as infinitesimally small over 13 billion years
ago, but why did it do that? Why at that time rather than any other? You tell
us that the frame of reference, space-time, is itself shaped by what exists
and that what exists could itself be structurings of space-time. But you also
say that you don't know how to construct a theory that unifies the major
theories of quantum mechanics and relativity. Isn't that rather odd?’19

If they looked carefully at the equations themselves they would find an even
stranger fact. The cosmological constants need to be adjusted to an
extraordinary degree of accuracy to make the existing universe possible.
Doesn't that imply that somewhere the theories have gone wrong?20

How should we respond to all of that? We would surely have to say that we
really don't know. But we could then go on to explain that all knowledge is
relative and that it may be asking the wrong question to require an ultimate
answer. A theory of everything may be a goal towards which one can
progressively move, but, like trying to accelerate an object towards the speed
of light, it may be impossible to say, finally, that we got there. Our
ancestors would therefore be right to be astonished at what we have
discovered, but they would also be right if their reaction was even deeper
puzzlement.

My, admittedly tentative, conclusion is to say that this may be a boundary
across which we cannot go. It could itself be a manifestation of the
relativity of epistemology. From a practical viewpoint, though, does it
matter? If, as I suggest, we can account for goal-directedness in evolution
without having to suppose that this requires that the universe itself should
have an ultimate goal, isn't that sufficient? We return to the insight of the
parable of the poisoned arrow. Why be too concerned to know who shot the arrow
when the urgent action is to remove it and treat the injury?

It was another of the great philosophers, Kant, who understood this relativity
of epistemology from a different perspective. He showed that we always need a
framework within which to interpret the world, but that the framework itself
may not be derivable from what we already know. That is why all science
requires a metaphysics if it is not to be mere cataloguing. That metaphysics
may not be derivable from purely empirical observations.

To use the terminology of Karl Popper, we can make conjectures that we may be
able to refute, but we can never be absolutely certain that they are true, nor
that there will not be a better conjecture.

### Ultimate Purpose?

There may or may not be an ultimate purpose, whatever that may mean. I doubt
whether empirical science can answer that question. But it certainly can use
the approach of Biological Relativity and the relativity of epistemology to
explain why organisms have genuine purposes and why creative purposiveness as
defined and used in this book is a real phenomenon that arises naturally from
the social interactions of organisms and which is therefore within the range
of knowledge of science.

To return to the very beginning of the book, we have seen much further than
our ancestors could when they looked up at the firmament. We have looked back
in time across aeons that they would have found unimaginable. We have also
observed inside ourselves and other living organisms and have done so right
down to the molecular level.

But, if the history of science tells us anything about the big why questions,
there can't be much doubt that future centuries will see discoveries beyond
what we can imagine today. I suggest that there will always be a relativistic
‘beyond’ – beyond what we can know.

### Notes

1 See Bowler, Peter (2001) Reconciling Science and Religion (University of
Chicago Press, Chicago, IL; p. 80): ‘Waddington had no interest in encouraging
scientists to revive an interest in religion.’ This is also clear from
Waddington's 1942 book Science and Ethics. His concern was for scientists to
be involved in the social process. To quote Bowler again, ‘his approach to
ethics was more in line with Huxley's vision of humanity continuing the course
of evolutionary progress by more efficient means’.

2 An interesting exception can be found in Capra, F. and P. Luisi (2014) The
Systems View of Life (Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; chapter 13).
Their approach to science and spirituality is very similar to mine. See

example in the Christian tradition. He referred to God as ‘no-thing’. His

‘departed’ in the sense of ‘deceased’. In the Jewish tradition, see Exodus
33:20: ‘You cannot see My face, for no man can see Me and live!’, which is
echoed in several New Testament verses. Buddhism is well-known to be an
essentially agnostic religion.

parable of the poisoned arrow comes from the earliest teachings of the Buddha.
It expresses the focus on what to do, rather than on what to believe.

11 Even a casual reading of Lamarck's work makes it clear that he was not a
vitalist. The French historian of genetics André Pichot wrote an excellent
introduction to the 1994 reprint of Philosophie Zoologique, in which he says
(my translation) ‘Lamarck's claim that…there is a radical difference between
living beings and inanimate objects might lead people to think that he was a
vitalist. But he is not. On the contrary, his biology is a mechanistic reply
to the physiological vitalism of Bichat, which was then the dominant theory’,

15 This theory was first proposed by Fisher and Haldane during the 1930s, and
later developed mathematically by Hamilton and Price. The alternative
approach, already referred to in [Chapter 7](book-part7.html#CT-bp-7), is to
develop the equations as part of a multi-level selection model, as done by
Nowak, Tarnita and Wilson. From such a viewpoint the gene-centric explanation
of altruism is incomplete. Needless to say, the Nowak et al. model is more
compatible with the theory of biological relativity.

original sin?

18 Just possibly, there might also be evidence for what may have led to the
big bang in the pattern of the background cosmic radiation. A theory proposed
by Roger Penrose leads to this idea. The singularity in Einstein's field
equations at the big bang would then be only an apparent singularity. See
Gurzadyan, V.G. and R. Penrose (2010) Concentric circles in WMAP data may

(SMPP) and the Standard Model of Cosmology (SMC) have no elements in common,
they are completely disjoint.’

20 The astronomer Martin Rees wrote a brilliant account of this problem in his
(1999) book Just Six Numbers: The Deep Forces that Shape the Universe
(Weidenfeld & Nicolson, London). Nearly two decades later we are no nearer any
explanation of the remarkable sensitivity of models of the universe to the
values of the constants required to enable the mathematical equations to
predict a universe in which life is possible. Rees maintains a nice balance
between enthusiasm for what scientific investigation can and will reveal, and
scepticism about exaggerated claims for science: ‘This perspective should
caution us against scientific triumphalism – against exaggerating how much
we'll ever really understand of nature's intricacies.’



## 10 Postscript

Why did the narrowly reductionist Neo-Darwinist view dominate biology for a
whole century?

There are many possible explanations, which will doubtless interest historians
and sociologists in the future. I can see two factors that have clearly
influenced me and can explain why so many biologists did not question it.
Recall, as explained in the introduction to [Chapter 6](book-part6.html#CT-
bp-6), that I began my scientific career firmly in the reductionist camp. I
know why it is attractive.

First, nineteenth- and early twentieth-century science had to distance itself
from all manner of fantastic, not to say ghostly, views of the world. In doing
so it retreated too far into what became a central citadel to be defended
vigorously at all costs, almost afraid to admit anything strange and
inexplicable in the universe. Physics peeled away from the entirety of that
view when quantum mechanics and Einstein's relativity theories appeared. But
all of that passed by with little notice in biology. The ultra-micro and the
ultra-macro scales seemed of little relevance to biology. As this book has
shown you, the general principle of relativity does have important
consequences for biology. It changes our view of causation.

Second, that citadel came to be surrounded by a simple protective narrative
that made it seem obvious that it was the repository of the only true faith.
Once the Weismann Barrier became accepted (and then seemed to be strengthened
by the Central Dogma) it appeared to be true that, even if organisms are open
systems, their genetic material is not. In such a world the only way in which
evolutionary change could occur would be by random (non-functional) variations
in the genetic material.

The narrative was completed by noting that evolution by natural selection is
then the only possible way. As popularisers often put it: ‘it's obvious, so
why do you need to drag in X?’ Where, for X, read all the processes that were
dismissed and all the people who were ostracised.

Can Biological Relativity be given a similarly simple and convincing
narrative? Complexity often loses out in popular debate because its more
nuanced approach is perceived to be not so easy to articulate. Appealing to
the gallery with simple slogans does not seem possible.

But, I think that, in summing up this book, it is perfectly possible to
formulate an alternative that is just as clear and just as obvious. It goes
like this:

  * Organisms, including their genetic material, are necessarily open systems.

  * Open systems are necessarily influenced by processes at larger scales. That is what we mean by an open system.

  * Meaning and function are natural features of larger-scale phenomena in biology, not of individual molecules.

  * The reason is that physico-chemical processes at smaller scales are necessarily constrained by higher scales. Even a molecular determinist has to admit this.

  * What is ordered and functional at higher scales can appear stochastic (random) and non-functional at lower scales.

  * Lack of purpose at the molecular scale does not therefore entail lack of purpose at other scales.

All pretty clear, and after reading this book, I hope they will appear fairly
obvious to the reader.

That's it in a nutshell. This is your new set of glasses.



### Glossary1

### Lamarckism

In this book I use the simplest and clearest definition of Lamarckism, which
is the inheritance of acquired characters. This definition is readily
testable. The idea of the inheritance of acquired characters, which is usually
seen as the hallmark of Lamarckism, was commonly accepted in Lamarck's day,
and Lamarck did not claim credit for it. He did claim credit, however, for the
idea that the inheritance of acquired characters could lead to the
transformation of species. During the twentieth century, Lamarckism became
associated mainly with the view that the inheritance of acquired characters
played a significant role in evolution, and was seen as an alternative to Neo-
Darwinism and to the Modern Synthesis.

If Lamarckism is to mean anything, then defining it as the antithesis of Neo-
Darwinism (Modern Synthesis) is appropriate. The counter-argument to this
definition is that it is not what Lamarck meant. Moreover, Lamarck could not
have anticipated the various epigenetic and other mechanisms now discovered by
which the inheritance of acquired characteristics can occur, any more than
Darwin could have anticipated the re-discovery of Mendel's genetic experiments
and the formulation of Neo-Darwinism. Lamarck was not a Lamarckian in the
modern sense. Nor was Darwin a Neo-Darwinist. It is important to recognise the
debate over the definition of Lamarckism because the founding father of
epigenetics, Conrad Waddington, was not a Lamarckian in the sense that became
prevalent since Weismann in the late nineteenth century – Lamarckism became
identified then with a transmission of information from the soma to germ line,
not with the general notion of acquired characters that can happen through
Mendelian mechanisms. A large spectrum of evolutionary doctrines became
associated with Lamarck's evolutionary theory that focus on the evolutionary
role of individual acquired (e.g. learnt or induced) variations that emerge
during the life of an organism in response to environmental changes. Concepts
such as the power of life, or the tendency for inexorable, predetermined
growth, also became associated with Lamarckism, and were appropriated by
philosophical, teleological and at times theologically oriented views of
evolution.2

### Darwinism

Darwin's theory of evolution by descent with modification is usually limited
to that part of the theory dealing with the mechanism of evolutionary change,
i.e. natural selection of heritable variations. Natural selection, usually
through competitive interactions, also features in Neo-Darwinism, which
elevates it to being both necessary and sufficient to explain evolution.
Darwin was far more cautious. He also acknowledged the inheritance of acquired
characteristics, on which he even formulated a mechanism (his theory of
pangenesis), and emphasised in The Origin of Species that natural selection
was not the only mechanism of evolution. I see the pluralist view of evolution
that has been re-emerging in recent years as, in some senses, a return towards
Darwin's more cautious position and away from strict and dogmatic Neo-
Darwinism. But we should not read too much into this. Darwin could not have
anticipated the developments in genetics, molecular biology and epigenetics
that have undermined strict Neo-Darwinism, any more than he could have
anticipated Neo-Darwinism itself.

### Neo-Darwinism and the Modern Synthesis

The term Neo-Darwinism was originally used by Romanes in 1896 to describe
Weismann's and Wallace's version of Darwinism, which specifically excluded the
inheritance of acquired characters. It is now commonly used to describe the
Modern Synthesis version of Darwinism, a wide-ranging consensus about the
nature and dynamics of evolutionary change that emerged amongst biologists
between the 1920s and 1950s, and was based on Neo-Darwinian assumptions,
including gradualism, and population genetics based on the assumption that
heritable variations are random (functionally blind). However, genetic change
is not always random (see the glossary item on Randomness), is not always
through gradual accumulation of small mutations, and the exclusion of the
inheritance of acquired characteristics is clearly wrong. This leaves a
puzzle. Many biologists who acknowledge these points still regard themselves
as adhering to the Neo-Darwinist Modern Synthesis, as though it can be
effortlessly extended to include almost anything that has been shown to occur
in nature. In my experience this is in part because many biologists do not
recall just how restrictive the original formulation of Neo-Darwinism is. And
the language of Neo-Darwinism is strongly compelling until one deconstructs it
(see [Chapter 5](book-part5.html#CT-bp-5) of this book). I believe it is more
honest to admit that the original formulation is no longer useful in a context
in which so many additional mechanisms of evolutionary change have been
found.3

### Randomness

Defining what is meant by ‘random’ is itself a major field of enquiry in
mathematics, computation and in science generally. The question of whether
there are truly random events in the universe is a vexed one, lying at the
heart of theories of quantum mechanics (see [Chapter 1](book-part1.html#CT-
bp-1)). Probably, we will never know, perhaps cannot know in principle, the
answer to that kind of question. But it warns us that defining randomness is
not easy.

The best way to sidestep the deeper problems is to ask the question ‘random
with respect to what?’. In evolutionary theory that makes the problem much
simpler. Both Neo-Darwinists and their opponents can then agree that what is
really meant is ‘random with respect to physiological (phenotypic) function’.
That is so because one of the central tenets of Neo-Darwinism is the exclusion
of any form of Lamarckism, the idea that function, or functional improvement,
can influence inheritance. By contrast, a Lamarckian must maintain that at
least some changes are not completely random with respect to function.

I approach this question in stages. The first stage is to establish that
genomic change is not random with respect to location in the genome. The
reason for asking that question first is that without establishing that there
are preferred locations of change, the argument for any kind of functionally
relevant change in the genome cannot even get off the ground. The only way in
which such a change can occur is through influencing the physical and chemical
properties of the genetic material. Preferred locations of change are
therefore a pre-condition for functional change to be possible. If all
locations in the genome were equipotent for changes there would be no
possibility for functionally relevant change. This approach is taken further
in the item on Function, and in [Chapter 7](book-part7.html#CT-bp-7).

### Function4

Function in physiology or evolutionary biology is usually defined as the
consistent causal role that a part plays within an encompassing human-designed
or natural-selection-designed system, a role that usually contributes to the
goal-oriented behaviour of this system. Since, from an evolutionary
perspective, the most general goal-directed behaviour of the encompassing
system is the reproductive success of the organism, the notions of function
and adaptive evolution through natural selection are closely related.5

### Genes

There is no universally correct or accepted definition of ‘gene’. Even
defining it as a DNA sequence coding for a protein (which is the usual modern
definition) creates ambiguities since many DNA sequences that do not code for
proteins also serve functional roles, and many different proteins can be coded
by the same DNA sequences, depending on how splicing and recombination occur.
Some of the definitions of a gene are even incompatible in their consequences
for evolutionary biology. The idea of Biological Relativity sidesteps many of
these problems by making it clear that there is no privileged level of
causation and that the nature of that causation with regard to genes naturally
depends on the definition. The reader is therefore best referred to [Chapter
5](book-part5.html#CT-bp-5) of this book and in particular to [Figure
5.3](book-part5.html#FIG-fig-33) and the text discussing it.

### Epigenetics

‘Epi’ means ‘above’, so epigenetics is ‘above’ genetics. The concept was first
introduced in the later 1930s by Conrad Waddington to refer to ‘the branch of
biology which studies the causal interactions between genes and their products
which bring the phenotype into being’.6 The term now refers to the study of
developmental processes in prokaryotes and eukaryotes that lead to persistent,
self-maintaining changes in the states of organisms, the components of
organisms or lineages of organisms. Epigenetic mechanisms underlie
developmental plasticity and canalisation. At the cellular level, these
mechanisms (e.g. DNA methylation of histone modifications) establish and
maintain the changes that occur during cell determination and differentiation
in both non-dividing cells, such as brain cells, and dividing cells, such as
stem cells. At higher levels of biological organisation, epigenetic mechanisms
underlie self-sustaining interactions between groups of cells, and between the
organism and its environment. Genetics in the sense of DNA inheritance is
under extensive control by many epigenetic mechanisms. Epigenetics can
therefore be viewed as the way in which organisms control and use their
genomes.

### Natural Genetic Engineering and Mobile Genetic Elements (‘Jumping Genes’)

These are the genomic modifications that are the result of a dedicated
machinery that alters the structure of the genome during sexual reproduction
(e.g. recombination), and following various genomic stresses (e.g. repair
mechanisms and transposition). Barbara McClintock, working on maize in the
1940s, was the first to show that genetic material can move around the genome,
even from one chromosome to another, and suggested that stress increases the
rate of transposition, but she was only awarded the Nobel Prize many decades
later, in 1983, for her discovery. We now know about many additional molecular
mechanisms by which transposition can be achieved. Reverse transcription from
RNA to DNA enables mobile RNAs to be inserted as DNA into the genome. There
are also cut-and-paste mechanisms that do not require an RNA intermediate.7

### Reductionism

Reductionism is the view that from knowledge of the structure and reactions of
the individual components of a system, and using that knowledge alone, it is
possible to understand and completely predict the behaviour of the whole. In
biology the components usually referred to in reductionist views are
molecular.

### Integrationism and Emergence

Integrationism is the opposite view that properties of the whole emerge as the
interactions both amongst the components and through interactions with the
environment of the system. Knowledge of the components alone is therefore not
sufficient.8

### Holism

Holism is a version of integrationism that emphasises the behaviour of the
whole.
