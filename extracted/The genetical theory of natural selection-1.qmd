## PREFACE

NATURAL Selection is not Evolution. Yet, ever since the two
wordshavebeenincommon use,thetheoryofNaturalSelection
has been employed as a convenient abbreviation for the theory of
Evolution by means of Natural Selection, put forward by Darwin
and Wallace. This has had the unfortunate consequence that the
theory of Natural Selection itself has scarcely ever, if ever, received
separateconsideration. To drawaphysicalanalogy,thelaws ofcon-
duction of heat in solids might be deduced from the principles of
statistical mechanics, yet it would have been an unfortunate limita-
tion, involving probably a great deal of confusion, if statistical
mechanics had only received consideration in connexion with the
conductionofheat. Inthiscaseitisclearthattheparticularphysical
phenomena examined are of little theoretical interest compared to
the principle by which they can be elucidated. The overwhelming
importance of evolution to the biological sciences partly explains
whythetheoryofNaturalSelectionshouldhavebeensofullyidenti-
fiedwithitsroleasanevolutionaryagency,astohavesufferedneglect
as an independent principle worthy of scientific study.

The other biologicaltheories which have been put forward, either
asauxiliaries, orasthesolemeansoforganicevolution, arenot quite
in the same position. For advocates of Natural Selection have not
failed to point out, what was evidently the chief attraction of the
theory to Darwin and Wallace, that it proposes to give an account
of the means of modification in the organic world by reference only
to *known
',
orindependentlydemonstrable, causes. The alternative
theories of modification rely, avowedly, on hypothetical properties
oflivingmatterwhich are inferredfrom thefactsofevolutionthem-
selves. Yet, although this distinction has often been made clear, its
logical cogency could never be fully developed in the absence of a
separate investigation of the independently demonstrable modes of
causation which are claimed as its basis. The present book, with all
the limitations of a first attempt, is at least an attempt to consider
thetheory ofNatural Selection onits own merits.

Whenthetheorywasfirstputforward, byfarthevaguestelement
inits compositionwastheprincipleofinheritance. Nomanoflearn-
ing or experience could deny this principle, yet, at the time, no
approachcouldbegiventoanexactaccountofitsworking. Thatan
independent studyofNaturalSelectionis now possible is principally
duetothegreat advancewhichourgenerationhasseeninthescience
of genetics. It deserves notice that the first decisive experiments,
which opened out in biology this field of exact study, were due to
a young mathematician, Gregor Mendel, whose statistical interests
extended to the physical and biological sciences. It is well known
that his experiments were ignored, to his intense disappointment,
and it is to be presumed that they were never brought under the
notice of any man whose training qualified him to appreciate their
importance. It is nolessremarkablethat when, in 1900, thegenetic
factshadbeenrediscoveredbyDe Vries,Tschermak,andCorrens,and
theimportanceofMendel'sworkwasatlastrecognized, theprincipal
opposition should have been encountered from the small group of
mathematical statisticians then engaged in the study of heredity.

The types ofmind which resultfrom training inmathematics and
in biology certainly differ profoundly; but the difference does not
seemtolieintheintellectualfaculty. Itwould
certainly
beamistake
tosaythatthemanipulationofmathematicalsymbolsrequires more
intellectthan originalthought in biology; on the contrary, it seems
much more comparable to the manipulation of the microscope and
its appurtenances of stains and fixatives ; whilst original thought in
bothspheresrepresentsverysimilaractivitiesofanidenticalfaculty.

This accords with the view that the intelligence, properly speaking,
is little influenced by the effects of training. What is profoundly
susceptible of training is the imagination, and mathematicians and
biologists seem to differ enormously in the manner in which their
imaginations are employed. Most biologists will probably feel that
this advantage is all ontheir side. They are introduced earlyto the
immense varietyof living things; their first dissections, evenif only
of the frog or dog fish, open up vistas of amazing complexity and
interest, at the time when the mathematician seems to be dealing
only with the barest abstractions, with lines and points, infinitely
thin laminae, and masses concentrated at ideal centres of gravity.

PerhapsIcanbestmakeclearthatthemathematician'simagination
also has been trained to some advantage, by quoting a remark
dropped casuallyby Eddingtonin arecentbook
*Weneed scarcely add that the contemplation in natural science of a
widerdomainthantheactualleadstoafarbetterunderstandingofthe
actual.* (p. 267, The Nature ofthe Physical World.)
For a mathematician the statement is almost a truism. From a
biologist, speaking of his own subject, it would suggest an extra-
ordinarily wide outlook. No practical biologist interested in
sexual reproduction would be led to work out the detailed con-
sequences experienced by organisms having three or more sexes;
yet whatelseshould he do if he wishes to understand whythe sexes
are, in fact, always two ? The ordinary mathematical procedure in
dealing with any actual problem is, after abstracting what are
believed to be the essential elements of the problem, to consider it
as one of a system of possibilities infinitely wider than the actual,
the essential relations of which may be apprehended by generalized
reasoning, and subsumedin generalformulae, which may be applied
at willto anyparticularcaseconsidered. Eventheword possibilities
inthisstatementundulylimits the scope of the practical procedures
inwhichheistrained ; forhe is early made familiar with the advan-
tages ofimaginarysolutions, andcanmost readilythinkofawave, or
an alternating current, in terms of the square root of minus one.

The most serious difficulty to intellectual co-operation would seem
to be removed if it were clearly and universally recognized that the
essential difference lies, not in intellectual methods, and still less
in intellectual ability, but in an enormous and specialized extension
of the imaginative faculty, which each has experienced in relation
to the needs of his specialsubject. I can imagine no more beneficial
change in scientific education than that which would allow each to
appreciate something of the imaginative grandeur of the realms of
thought explored bythe other.

In the future, the revolutionary effect of Mendelisin will be seen
to flow from the particulate character of the hereditary elements.

Onthisfact arationaltheory ofNaturalSelection canbe based, and
itis,therefore,ofenormousimportance. Themeritforthisdiscovery
mustmainlyrestwithMendel,whilstamongourcountrymen,Bateson
played theleading partinits earlyadvocacy. Unfortunatelyhewas
unprepared to recognize the mathematical or statistical aspects of
biology, and from this and other causes he was not only incapable
of framing an evolutionary theory himself, but entirely failed to see
how Mendelism supplied the missing parts of the structure first
erected by Darwin. His interpretation of Mendelian facts was from
the first too exclusively coloured by his earlier belief in the dis-
continuous origin of specific forms. Though his influence upon
evolutionary theory was thus chieflyretrogressive, the mighty body
of Mendelian researches throughout the world has evidently out-
grownthefallacieswithwhichitwasatfirstfostered. Asapioneerof
genetics he has done more thanenoughtoexpiatetherashpolemics
of his early writings.

To treat Natural Selection as an agency based independently on
its own foundations is not to mimimize its importance inthe theory
ofevolution. Onthecontrary, assoonaswe requiretoformopinions
by other means than by comparison and analogy, such an indepen-
dent deductive basis becomes a necessity. This necessityis particu-
larlyto benotedfor mankind
;
sincewe have someknowledge ofthe
structure of society, of human motives, and of the vital statistics of
this species, the use of the deductive method can supply a more
intimate knowledge of the evolutionary processes than is elsewhere
possible. In addition it will be of importance for our subject to call
attentiontoseveralconsequencesoftheprincipleofNaturalSelection
which,sincetheydonotconsistintheadaptivemodificationofspecific
forms, have necessarilyescapedattention. The geneticphenomenaof
dominanceand
linkage
seemtoofferexamplesofthisclass,thefuture
investigation of which may add greatlytothe scope of our subject.

No efforts of mine could avail to make the book easy reading.

I have endeavoured to assist the reader by giving short summaries
at the ends of all chapters, except Chapter IV, whichis summarized
conjointly with Chapter V. Those who prefer to do so may regard
Chapter IV as a mathematical appendix to the corresponding part
of the summary. The deductions respecting Man are strictly in-
separable from the more general chapters, but have been placed
together in a group commencing with Chapter VIII. I believe no
one will be surprised that a large number of the points considered
demand afarfuller, more rigorous, and more comprehensive treat-
ment. It seems impossible that full justice should be done to the
subjectinthisway,untilthereisbuiltupatraditionofmathematical
work devoted to biological problems, comparable to the researches
upon which a mathematical physicist can draw in the resolution of
special difficulties.

This mere variability (causing the child not closely to resemble its parent)
I look at as very differentfrom theformation of a marked variety or new
species. DARWIN, 1856. (Life andLetters, ii, 87.)
As Samuel Butler so truly said: 'To me it seems that the "Origin of
Variation",whateveritis,istheonlytrue " OriginofSpecies'V w. BATESON,
1909.

The consequences of the blending theory
THAT Charles Darwin accepted the fusion or blending theory of
inheritance, just as all men accept many of the undisputed beliefs
of their time, is universally admitted. That his acceptance of this
theory had animportant influence on his views respectingvariation,
and consequently on the views developed by himself and others on
the possible causes of organic evolution, was not, I think, apparent
to himself, noris it sufficiently appreciatedinourowntimes. Inthe
course of the present chapter I hope to make clear the logical con-
sequences of the blending theory, and to show their influence, not
only on the development of Darwin's views, but on the change of
attitude towards these, and other suppositions, necessitated by the
acceptance of the opposite theory of particulate inheritance.

It is of interest that the need for an alternative to blending in-
heritance was certainly felt by Darwin, though probably he never
worked out a distinct idea of a particulate theory. In a letter to
Huxley probably dated in 1857 occur the sentences (More Letters,
vol. i, Letter 57).

Approachingthe subject from the side which attracts me most, viz.,
inheritance, I have lately been inclined to speculate, very crudely and
indistinctly, that propagation by true fertilization will turn out to be
a sort of mixture, and not true fusion, of two distinct individuals, or
rather of innumerable individuals, as each parent has its parents and
ancestors. Icanunderstandonno otherviewthewayinwhichcrossed
forms go backto solarge an extentto ancestralforms. But allthis, of
course, isinfinitelycrude.

The idea apparently was never developed, perhaps owing to the
rush of work which preceded and followed the publication of the
Origin. Certainly he did not perceive that the arguments on varia-
tion in his rough essays of 1842 and 1844, which a year later (1858)
he would be rewriting in the form of the first chapter of the Origin,
would on a particulate theory have required him entirely to recast
them. Thesameviewsindeedarebutlittlechangedwhen'Thecauses
of variability' came to be discussed in Chapter XXII of Variation of
Animals and Plants published in 1868.

The argument which canbe reconstructed from these foursources
may be summarized as follows
:
(a) with blending inheritance bisexual reproduction will tend
rapidly to produce uniformity ;
(6) if variability persists, causes of new variation must be con-
tinually at work ;
(c) the causes of the great variability of domesticated species, of
all kinds arid in all countries, must be sought forin the condi-
tionsofdomestication
;
(d) the only characteristics of domestication sufficiently general
to cover all cases are changed conditions andincrease offood
;
(e) some changes of conditions seem to produce definite and
regulareffects, e. g. increasedfoodcauses (hereditary) increase
in size, but the important effect is an indefinite variability in
all directions, ascribable to a disturbance, by change of condi-
tions, of the regularity of action of the reproductive system ;
(/) wildspeciesalsowilloccasionally, bygeologicalchanges, suffer
changedconditions, and occasionallyalso atemporaryincrease
in the supply of food; they will therefore, though perhaps
rarely, be causedto vary. If on these occasionsno selection is
exerted the variations will neutralize one another by bisexual
reproduction and die away, but if selection is acting, the
variationsintherightdirectionwillbe accumulatedanda
per-
manent evolutionary change effected.

To modern readers this will seem a very strange argument with
which to introduce the case for Natural Selection all that is gained
byitis theinferencethatwildaswellas domesticatedspecies willat
least occasionally present heritable variability. Yet it is used to
introduce the subject in the two essays andin the Origin. It should
be remembered that, at the time of the essays, Darwin had little
direct evidence on this point; even in the Origin the second chapter
on 'Variation under Nature' deals chiefly with natural varieties
sufficientlydistincttobelistedbybotanists, andthesewere
certainly
regarded by Darwin not as the materials but as the products of
evolution. During the twenty-six years between 1842 and 1868 evi-
dence musthaveflowedin sufficiently atleast to convince him that
heritablevariability wasaswidespread,thoughnotnearlyasextensive,
in wild as in domesticated species. Thelineof reasoningin question
seems tohavelostitsimportancesufficientlyforhimtointroducethe
subjectin 1868 (Variation, ChapterXXII) with the words 'The sub-
jectisanobscureone
;
butitmaybeusefultoprobeour
ignorance.'
It is the great charm of the essays that they show the reasons
which led Darwin to his conclusions, whereas the later works often
only give the evidence upon which the reader is to judge of their
truth. The antithesis is not so heterodox as it sounds, for every
active mind will form opinions without direct evidence, else the
evidence too often would never be collected. Impartiality and
scientific discipline come in in submitting the opinions formed to as
much relevant evidence as can be made available. The earlier steps
in the argument set out above appear only in the two essays, while
the conclusions continue almost unchanged up to the Variation of
Animals and Plants. Indeed the first step (a), logically the most
importantofall, appearsexplicitlyonlyin 1842. In 1844itisclearly
implied by its necessary consequences. I believe its significance for
the argument of the Origin, would scarcely ever be detected from
a study only ofthat book. The passage inthe 1842 MS. is (Founda-
tions, p. 2):
Each parent transmits its peculiarities, therefore if varieties allowed
freely to cross, except by the chance of two characterized by same
peculiarity happening to marry, such varieties will be constantly de-
molished. All bisexual animals must cross, hermaphrodite plants do
cross, it seems very possible that hermaphrodite animals do cross
conclusionstrengthened:
together with a partly illegible passage of uncertain position,
If individuals of two widely different varieties be allowed to cross,
a third race will be formed a most fertile source of the variation in
domesticatedanimals. Iffreelyallowed, the characters ofpureparents
will be lost, number of races thus [illegible] but differences [?] besides
the
[illegible].

Butifvarietiesdifferinginveryslightrespectsbeallowed
tocross, suchsmallvariationwillbedestroyed, atleastto oursenses
avariation just to be distinguished bylong legs will have offspring not
to be so distinguished. Free crossing great agent in producing uni-
formityinanybreed.

The proposition is an important one, marking as it docs the great
contrast between the blending and the particulate theories of in-
heritance. The following proof establishes itin biometricalterms.

Let x and y represent the deviations in any measurement of the
two parents from the specific mean ; if the measurement is affected
not only by inheritance, but by non-heritable (environmental)
factors also, x and ystand forthe heritable part of these deviations.

The amount of variability present in any generation of individuals
will be measured by the variance, defined as the mean value of the
square of x, or of y. In purely blending inheritance the heritable
portions of the deviations of the offspring will be, apart from muta-
tions, equal to %(x + y); in the absence of such mutations, therefore,
the variance of the progeny generation will be the mean value of
The mean values of x and y are both zero, since they are both
defined as deviations fromthe mean ofthe species; consequently, in
theabsenceofselectivemating,themeanvalueofxyisalsozero, and
thevariance oftheprogenygenerationisfoundtobeexactlyhalfthe
variance oftheparentalgeneration. More generallytheratioisnot |
but \(l+r), where r is the correlation between x and y. r cannot
exceed unity, else the average value ofthe positive quantities (x-y) 2

andcanonlybeunity,iftheyareallzero,
that is, if the size ofeachindividual prescribes exactlythe size of its
possible mates. Darwin's 'except by the chance of two individuals
characterized by same peculiarities happening to marry' is his way
ofrejecting high correlations as improbable.

The effect ofcorrelation betweenmates isto hasten, ifthe correla-
tion is negative, or to retard if positive, the tendency of blending
inheritancetoreducethevariance sucheffectsarenotofimportance,
;
for even if the correlation were as high as 0-5, and mates had to be
asmuchalikeasparentandchildusually are,therateofdecaywould
belittlemorethanhalved. The important consequenceoftheblend-
ing is that, if not safeguarded by intense marital correlation, the
heritable variance is approximately halved in every generation. To
maintain a stationary variance fresh mutations must be available in
each generation to supply the half of the variance so lost. If vari-
ability persists, as Darwin rightlyinferred, causes of new variability
must continuallybeatwork. Almosteveryindividualofeachgenera-
tion must be a mutant, i. e. must be influenced by such causes, and
moreover must be a mutant in many different characters.

An inevitable inference of the blending theory is that the bulk of
the heritable variance present at any moment is of extremelyrecent
origin. One halfis newineach generation, andoftheremainderone
halfisonlyonegenerationolder, andsoon. Lessthanone-thousandth
of the variance can be ten generations old; even if by reason of
selective mating we ought to say twenty generations, the general
conclusion is the same ; the variability of domesticated species must
be ascribedby anyadherent oftheblendingtheorytothe conditions
ofdomestication as they nowexist. Ifvariationistobe usedbythe
human breeder, or by natural selection, it must be snapped up at
once, soon after the mutation has appeared, and before it has had
time to die away. The following passage from the 1844 essay shows
that Darwin was perfectly clear onthis point (pp. 84-6).

Let us then suppose that an organism by some chance (which might
be hardly repeated in 1,000 years) arrives at a modern volcanic island
inprocessofformationandnotfullystockedwiththemostappropriate
organisms
;

Theeffectofthiswemightexpectwouldinfluenceinsomesmalldegree
thesize,colour,natureofcovering, &c.,andfrom inexplicableinfluences
even special parts and organs of the body. But we mightfurther (and
this is farmore important) expect that the reproductive system would
be affected, as under domesticity, and the structure of the offspring
rendered in some degree plastic. Hence almost everypart of the body
would tend to vary from the typical form in slight degrees, and in no
determinate way, and therefore without selection the free crossing of
these small variations (together with the tendency to reversion to the
original form) would constantly be counteracting this unsettling effect
of the extraneous conditions on the reproductive system. Such, I con-
ceive, would be the unimportant result without selection. And here
I must observe that the foregoing remarks are equally applicable to
that smalland admitted amount ofvariationwhich has been observed
in some organisms in a state of nature ; as well as to the above hypo-
theticalvariationconsequentonchangesofcondition.

Let us now suppose a Being with penetration sufficient to perceive

Difficulties felt by Darwin
The argument based on blendinginheritance and its logicalcon-
sequences, though it certainly represents the general trend of
Darwin's thought upon inheritance and variation, for some years
after he commenced pondering on the theory of Natural Selection,
did not satisfy him completely. Reversion he recognized as a fact
which stood outside his scheme of inheritance, and that he was not
altogethersatisfiedto regardit as an independentprinciple is shown
by his letter to Huxley already quoted. By 1857 he was in fact on
the verge of devising a scheme of inheritance which should include
reversionas oneofitsconsequences. The variabilityofdomesticated
races, too, presented a difficulty which, characteristically, did not
escapehim. Henotes (pp. 77, 78,Foundations)in 1844thatthemost
ancientlydomesticatedanimals and plants arenotlessvariable, but,
if anything more so, than those more recently domesticated; and
arguesthatsince the supply of food could not have been becoming
much more abundant progressively at all stages of a long history of
domestication, this factor cannot alone account for the great varia-
bility which still persists. The passage runs as follows:
If it be an excessoffood,comparedwiththatwhichthebeingobtained
in its natural state, the effects continue for an improbably long time ;
during howmanyageshaswheatbeencultivated, andcattleandsheep
reclaimed, and we cannot suppose their amount of food has gone on
increasing, nevertheless these are amongst the most variable of our
domestic productions.

This difficulty offers itself also to the second supposed cause of
variability, namely changed conditions, though here it may be
argued that the conditions of cultivation ornurture of domesticated
species have always been changing more or less rapidly. From a
passage inthe Variation of AnimalsandPlants (p. 301), whichruns:
Moreover, itdoes not appearthat a changeofclimate,whethermore
or less genial, is one of the most potent causes of variability; for in
regard to plants Alph. De Candolle, in his Geographic Botanique, re-
peatedly shows thatthenative country of a plant, whereinmost cases
it has been longest cultivated, is that where it has yielded the greatest
numberofvarieties.

it appears that Darwin satisfied himself that the countries in which
animals or plants were first domesticated, were at least as prolific
ofnewvarieties asthe countries into whichtheyhadbeenimported,
and it is natural to presume that his inquiries underthis head were
in search ofevidence bearinguponthe effects ofchanged conditions.

It is not clear that this difficulty was ever completely resolved in
Darwin's mind, but it is clear from many passages that he saw the
necessity of supplementing the original argument by postulating
thatthe causes ofvariation which act uponthereproductive system
must be capable of acting in a delayed and cumulative manner so
that variation might still be continuedformany subsequent genera-
tions.

Particulate inheritance
It is a remarkablefactthat had anythinkerinthe middle ofthe
nineteenthcenturyundertaken, asa pieceofabstractandtheoretical
analysis, thetaskofconstructingaparticulatetheoryofinheritance,
he would have been led, on the basis of a few very simple assump-
tions, to produce a system identical with the modern scheme of
scars and mutilations would have prepared him to conceive of the
hereditarynatureofan organism assomethingnone theless definite
because possibly represented inexactly by its visible appearance.

Had he assumed that this hereditary nature was completely deter-
mined by the aggregate of the hereditary particles (genes), which
enter into its composition, and at the same time assumed that
organisms of certain possible types of hereditary composition were
capable of breeding true, he would certainly have inferredthat each
organismmustreceiveadefiniteportionofitsgenesfromeachparent,
andthatconsequentlyitmusttransmit only acorrespondingportion
to each of its offspring. The simplification that, apart from sex and
possibly other characters related in their inheritance to sex, the
contributions of the two parents were equal, would not have been
confidently assumed without the evidence of reciprocal crosses ; but
our imaginary theorist, having won so far, would scarcely have
failedto imagine a conceptualframeworkin which eachgene hadits
properplace orlocus, whichcouldbe occupiedalternatively, hadthe
parentage been different, by a gene of a different kind. Those
organisms (homozygotes) which received like genes, in any pair of
correspondingloci,
fromtheirtwo
parents,
would
necessarily
handon
genesofthiskindtoalloftheiroffspringalike ; whereasthose (hetero-
zygotes) which received from their two parents genes of different
kinds, and would be, in respect of the locus in question, crossbred,
wouldhave, inrespectofanyparticularoffspring, anequalchance of
transmitting either kind. The heterozygote when mated to either
kind of homozygote would produce both heterozygotes and homo-
zygotes in aratio which, with increasing numbers of offspring, must
tend to equality, while if two heterozygotes were mated, each
homozygous form would bo expected to appear in a quarter of the
offspring, the remaining half being heterozygous. It thus appears
that, apart from dominance and linkage, including sex linkage, all
the main characteristics of the Mendelian system flow from assump-
tions of particulate inheritance of the simplest character, and could
have been deduced a priori had any one conceived it possible that
the laws of inheritance could really be simple and definite.

The segregation of single pairs of genes, that is of single factors,
wasdemonstratedbyMendelinhispaperof 1865. InadditionMendel
demonstratedhihis materialthefactof dominance, namelythatthe
heterozygote was notintermediate in appearance, but was almost or
quite indistinguishable from one ofthehomozygousforms. The fact
of dominance, though of the greatest theoretical interest, is not an
essential feature of the factorial system, and in several important
casesislackingaltogether. Mendelalsodemonstratedwhatatheorist
could scarcely have ventured to postulate, that the different factors
examinedbyhimin combination, segregatedinthe simplestpossible
manner, namely independently. It was not till afterthe rediscovery
ofMendel'slaws attheend ofthe centurythatcases oflinkage were
discovered, in which, for factors in the same linkage group, the pair
of genes received from the same parent are more often than not
handed on together to the same child. The conceptual framework
of loci must therefore be conceived as made of several parts, and
these are now identified, on evidence which appears to be singularly
complete, with the dark-staining bodies or chromosomes which are
tobe seeninthenuclei of cellsatcertainstages ofcelldivision.

The mechanism of particulate inheritance is evidently suitable for
reproducing the phenomenon of reversion, in which an individual
resembles a grandparent or more remote ancestor, in some respect
in which it differs from its parents for the ancestral gene combina-
;
tionmaybychancebereproduced. Thistakesitssimplest formwhen
dominance occurs, for every union of two heterozygotes will then
produce among the offspring some recessivcs, differingin appearance
from their parents, but probably resembling some grandparent or
ancestor.

Conservation of the variance
It has not been so clearlyrecognized thatparticulateinheritance
differs from the blending theory in an even more important fact.

There is no inherent tendency for the variability to diminish. In
a population breeding at random in which two alternative genes of
anyfactor, existintheratiopto g, thethreegenotypes will occurin
the ratiop2 : 2pq : g 2 , and thus ensure that their characteristics will
be represented in fixed proportions of the population, however they
may be combined with characteristics determined by other factors,
provided that the ratio p :q remains unchanged. This ratio will
indeed be liable to slight changes ; first by the chance survival and
reproduction of individuals of the different kinds and secondly by
;
selective survival, by reason of the fact that the genotypes are pro-
bably unequally fitted, at least to a slight extent, to their task of
survival and reproduction. The effect of chance survival is easily
susceptible of calculation, and it appears, as will be demonstrated
more fully (ChapterIV), thatin apopulation ofnindividualsbreed-
ing atrandom the variance willbe halved by this cause acting alone
in 1-4 n generations. Since the number of individuals surviving to
reproduce in each generation must in most species exceed a million,
andinmanyis atleastamillion-foldgreater, itwillbe seenthatthis
causeofthediminutionofhereditaryvarianceisexceedinglyminute,
when compared to the rate of halving in one or two generations by
blending inheritance.

It will be seeninChapter IVthat selection is a much more impor-
tant agencyin keepingthe variability of species within limits. But
even relatively intense selection will change the ratio p : q of the
gene frequencies relatively slowly, and no reasonable assumptions
could be made by whichthe diminution ofvariance due to selection,
in the total absence of mutations, would be much more than aten-
thousandthofthatascribabletoblendinginheritance. Theimmediate
consequence of this enormous contrast is that the mutation rate
neededtomaintainagiven amountofvariabilityis, ontheparticulate
theory, many thousandtimes smallerthan thatwhich is required on
the blending theory. Theories, therefore, which ascribe to agencies
believed to be capable of producing mutations, as was 'use and
disuse' by Darwin, a power of governing the direction in which
evolution is taking place, appear in very different lights, according
as one theory of inheritance, or the other, is accepted. For any
evolutionary tendency which is supposed to act by favouring muta-
tions in one direction rather than another, and a number of such
mechanisms havefromtimetotimebeenimagined, willloseitsforce
many thousand-fold, when the particulate theory of inheritance, in
any form, is accepted; whereas the directing power of Natural
Selection, depending as it does on the amount of heritable variance
maintained, is totally uninfluenced by any such change. This con-
sideration, which applies to all suchtheories alike, is independent of
the fact that a great part of the reason, at least to Darwin, for
ascribing to the environment any considerable influence in the pro-
ductionofmutations, issweptawaywhenwe areno longerforcedto
consider the great variability of domestic species as due to the
comparativelyrecentinfluence oftheir artificialenvironment.

The striking fact, of which Darwin was well aware, that whole
brothers and sisters, whose parentage, and consequently whose
entire ancestry is identical, may differ greatly in their hereditary
composition, bears under the two theories two very different inter-
pretations. Under the blending theory it is clear evidence of new
and frequent mutations, governed, as the greater resemblance of
twins suggests, by temporary conditions acting during conception
and
gestation.

Ontheparticulatetheoryitisanecessaryconsequence
of the fact that for every factor a considerable fraction, not often
muchlessthanonehalf, ofthe populationwillbeheterozygotes, any
two offspring of which will be equally likely to receive unlike as like
genes from their parents. In view of the close analogy between the
statistical concept of variance and the physical concept of energy,
we may usefully think of the heterozygote as possessing variance in
a potential or latent form, so that instead of being lost when the
homozygous genotypes are mated it is merely stored in a form from
whichitwilllaterreappear. A population matedatrandomimmedi-
ately establishes the condition of statistical equilibrium between the
latent and the apparent form of variance. The particulate theory of
inheritance resembles the kinetic theory of gases with its perfectly
elastic collisions, whereas the blending theory resembles a theory of
gases with inelastic collisions, and in which some outside agency is
requiredto be continually at workto keep the particles astir.

The property of the particulate theory of conserving the variance
for an indefinite period explains at once the delayed or cumulative
effect of domestication in increasing the variance of domesticated
species, to which Darwin calls attention. Many of our domesticated
varieties areevidentlyill-fittedto surviveinthewild condition. The
mutations by which they arose may have been occurring for an
indefinite period prior to domestication without establishing them-
selves, or appreciably affecting the variance, of the wild species. In
domestication, however, not only is the rigour of Natural Selection
relaxedsothatmutanttypescansurvive, andeachsuchsurvivaladd
somethingtothestore ofheritable variance, butnovelties ofform or
colour, even if semi-monstrous, do undoubtedly attract human
attention and interest, and are valued by man for their peculiarity.

The rapidity with which new variance is accumulated will thus be
enhanced. Without postulating any change hi the mutation rates
duetodomestication, weshouldnecessarilyinferfromwhatis known
species should be greater than that of similar wild species, and that
this contrast should be greatest with those species most anciently
domesticated. Thus one of the main difficulties felt by Darwin is
resolved by the particulate theory.

Theories of evolution worked by mutations
The theories ofevolution which relyupon hypothetical agencies,
capable of modifying the frequency or direction in which mutations
are taking place, fall into four classes. In stating these it will be
convenienttousetheterm 'mutation',towhichmanymeaningshave
atdifferenttimesbeen assigned,todenotesimplytheinitiationofany
heritable novelty.

(A) It may be supposed, as by Lamarck in the case of animals,
that the mental state, and especially the desires of the organism,
possessthe power of producing mutations of such a kind, that these
desires may be more readily gratified in the descendants. This view
postulates (i) that there exists a mechanism by which mutations are
caused, and even designed, in accordance with the condition of the
nervous system, and (ii) that the desires of animals in general are
such that their realization will improve the aptitude of the species
forlifeinitsnaturalsurroundings, andalsowillmaintain orimprove
the aptitude of its parts to co-operate with one another, both in
maintaining the vital activity of the adult animal, and in ensuring
itsnormalembryologicaldevelopment. The desires ofanimals must,
infact,beverywiselydirected, aswellasbeingeffectiveinprovoking
suitable mutations.

A
(B) power of adaptation may be widely observed, both among
plants and animals, by which particular organs, such as muscles or
glands, respond by increased activity andincreased size, when addi-
tionalphysiologicalcalls are made uponthem. Itmaybesuggested,
as it was by Darwin, that such responses of increased functional
activityinduce, orare accompanied by, mutationsof akind tending
to increase the size or activity of the organ in question in future
generations, even if no additional calls were made upon this organ's
activity. Thisview implies(i) thatthepowerwhich partsoforganisms
possess, of responding adaptively to increased demands upon them,
is not itself a product of evolution, but must be postulated as a
primordialpropertyof living matter: and requires (ii) that amecha-
nismexistsbywhichthe adaptive responseshallitselftend tocause,
or be accompanied by, an appropriate mutation.

Both these two suggested means of evolution expressly aim at
explaining, not merely the progressive change of organic beings, but
theaptitudeoftheorganismtoitsplaceinnature, andofitspartsto
theirfunction in the organism.

(C) It may be supposed that the environment in which the or-
ganism is placed controls the nature of the mutations which occur
in it, and so directs its evolutionary course ; much as the course of
a projectileiscontrolledbythefieldofforceinwhichitflies.

(D) It may be supposed that the mutations which an organism
undergoes are due to an 'inner urge' (not necessarilyconnected with
itsmental state)implantedinitsprimordialancestors,whichthereby
directs its predestined evolution.

The two last suggestions give no particular assistance towards the
understanding of adaptation, but each contains at leastthis element
of truth; that however profound our ignorance of the causes of
mutation may be, we cannot but ascribe them, within the order of
Nature as we know it, either to the nature of the organism, or to
that ofitssurroundingenvironment, or, more generally,totheinter-
action of the two. What is common, however, to all four of these
suppositions, is that each one postulates thatthe direction of evo-
lutionary change isgovernedbythe predominant directionin which
mutationsaretakingplace. Howeverreasonablesuchanassumption
might have seemedwhen, under the blending theory ofinheritance,
everyindividualwas regarded as a mutant, and probablya multiple
mutant, it is impossible to let it pass unquestioned, in face of the
much lower mutation rates appropriate to the participate theory.

A
further hypothetical mechanism, guiding the evolution of the
species according to the direction in which mutations are occur-
ring, was suggestedbyWeismann. Weismann appreciated muchmore
thoroughly than many of his contemporaries the efficacy of Natural
Selection, in promoting the adaptation of organisms to the needs of
theirlivesintheiractualhabitats. He felt, however, thatthis action
would be aided in a subordinate degree if the process of mutation
could acquire a kind of momentum, so that a series of mutations
affecting the increase or decrease of apart shouldcontinue to occur,
as aconsequence ofaninitialchancetendencytowards suchincrease
ordecrease. Suchanassumedmomentumintheprocess ofmutation
hefoundusefulintwo respects:(i)itwouldenableanassumedminimal
mutation in an advantageous direction to be increased by further
mutations, until it 'attains selectionvalue' ; (ii) it explains the con-
tinuous decrease ofauseless organ, without assumingthateach step
of this decrease confers any advantage upon the organism mani-
festing it.

The concept of attaining selection value, which is fairly common
inbiologicalliterature, seemstocovertwo distinctcases. Inthefirst
case we may imagine that, with increasing size, the utility of an
organ shows no increase up to a certain point, but that beyond this
point increasing size is associated with increasing utility. In such
a case, which, in view of the actual variability of every organism,
andof thepartsofrelatedorganisms, must beregarded as somewhat
ideal, we are really only concerned with the question whether the
actualvariabilityindifferent members of the species concerned, does
or does notreach as far as the critical point. Ifit does not do so the
specieswillnotbe abletotaketheadvantage offered, simplybecause
itis notvariableenough, andthepostulate ofanelementofmomen-
tum in the occurrence of mutations, was certainly not made in
order to allow organisms to be more variable than they would be
without it.

The second meaning, which is also common in the literature,
depends upon a curious assumption as to the manner in which
selective advantage increases with change of size of the organ upon
whichthisadvantageis dependent foritissometimesassumedthat,
;
while at all sizes an increase of size may be advantageous, this
advantageincreases, not continuously, butin a step-like manner; or
at least that increases below a certain limit produce an advantage
which may be called 'inappreciable', and therefore neglected, Both
the metaphor and the underlying idea appear to be drawn from
psychophysical experience. If we compare two physical sensations
such as those producedbythe weights oftwo objects, thenwhenthe
weights are sufficientlynearly equal the subject will often be unable
to distinguish between them, and will judge them equal, whereas
witha greaterdisparity, adistinctorappreciabledifferenceofweight
is discerned. If, however, the same test is applied to the subject
repeatedlywithdifferencesbetweentheweightsvaryingfromwhatis
easily discernible to very much smaller quantities, it is found that
differencesinthe weights, which would be deemed totally inappreci-
able, yet make a significant and perfectly regular difference to the
frequency with which one is judged heavier than the other. The
discontinuity lies in our interpretation of the sensations, and not in
the sensations themselves. Now, survival value is measured by the

frequency with which certain events, such as death or reproduction,
occur, todifferentsorts oforganismsexposedtothedifferentchances
ofthesameenvironment,and,evenif weshouldotherwisebeindoubt,
the psychophysical experiments make it perfectly clear that the
selective advantage will increase or decrease continuously, even for
changes much smaller than those appreciable to our own senses, or
to those of the predator or other animal, which may enter into the
biological situation concerned. If a change of 1 mm. has selection
value, a change of 0-1 mm. will usually have a selection value
approximately one-tenth asgreat, and the change cannotbeignored
because we deem it inappreciable. The rate at which a mutation
increases in numbers at the expense of its allelomorph will indeed
depend on the selective advantage it confers, but the rate at which
a species responds to selection in favour of any increase or decrease
of parts depends on the total heritable variance available, and not
onwhetherthisis suppliedbylarge or smallmutations. There isno
limen of appreciable selection value to be considered.

The remaining advantage which Weismann sought in postulating
his mechanism of germinal selection was to supply an explanation
ofthe progressive diminution of useless organs, even when these are
of so trifling a character that the selective advantage of their sup-
pression is questionable. The subject is an interesting one, and
deserves for its own sake a more extended discussion than would be
suitable in the present book. For our present purpose it will be
sufficient to notice (i) that to assert in any particular case that the
progressive suppression of an organ brings with it no progressive
selective advantage appears to be veryfar beyond the range of our
actual knowledge. To take a strong case from Weismann the
receptaculum seminis of an ant is assuredly minute but the ant her-
;
selfis not very large, nor are we concerned onlywith the individual
ant,butwiththewholeworkerpopulationofthenest. Asaneconomic
problem we certainly do not possess the data to decide whether the
suppression of this minute organ would or would not count as an
appreciablefactorintheant
polity. Human parallels mightbegiven
in which the elimination of very minute items of individual waste,
can lend an appreciable support to social institutions which are
certainly not negligible. I do not assert that the suppression of the
receptaculum has been useful to the ant, but that in this as in other
cases, if we pause to give the matter due consideration, it is at once
apparent that we have not the knowledge on which to base any
decided answer, (ii) In the second place Weismann's view that in
theabsenceofallselectionauselessorganmightdiminish,degenerate,
and finally disappear, by the cumulative action of successive muta-
tions, and especiallyhisviewthatthisisthe onlytype ofprogressive
change, which could take place by mutations only, without the
guidance of Natural Selection, is fully in accordance with modern
knowledge of the nature of mutations. The special mechanism,
however, by which he sought to explainthe successive occurrence of
degenerative mutations must be judged to be superfluous. It is
moreover exposed to the logical objection that the driving force of
his mechanism of germinal selection is an assumed competition for
nutriment between the chromatin elements which represent the
degenerating organ, and those whichrepresent the rest of the body.

The degenerating organ itself is assumed to be so unimportant that
itsdemandsuponthegeneralnutritionofthebodyaretobeneglected;
and it may well be asked if it is legitimate to bring in, in respect of
the well-nourished germ cell, the factor of nutritional competition
which is to be ignored in the occasionally ill-nourishedbody.

Is all inheritance participate?
The logical case forrejecting the assumptionthatthe direction of
evolutionarychangeisgoverned bythe directioninwhichmutations
are taking place, and thereby rejecting the whole group of theories
in which this assumption is implicit, would be incomplete had not
modern researches supplied the answer to two further questions:
(i) May it not be that in addition to the mechanism of particulate
inheritance, which has been discovered and is being investigated,
there is also, in living organisms, an undiscovered mechanism of
blendinginheritance? (ii) Do the knownfacts withinthe particulate
system render a mechanism, which could control the predominant
direction of mutation, inoperative as a means of governing the
direction of evolutionary change?
On the first point it should be noted briefly that, whereas at the
beginning of the century there were several outstanding facts of
inheritance which seemed to demand some sort of blending theory,
these have all in the course of research been shown, not only to be
compatible with particulate inheritance, but to reveal positive
indicationsthatsuchistheirnature. The apparentblendingincolour
in crosses between white races of man and negroes is compatible
with the view that these races differ in several Mendelian factors,
affecting the pigmentation. Of these some may have intermediate
heterozygotes, andoftheremainderinsome the darker, andinsome
the lighter tint may be dominant. The Mendelian theory is alone
competenttoexplaintheincreasedvariabilityof theoffspringof the
mulattoes.

The biometrical facts as to the inheritance of stature and other
humanmeasurements, though atfirstregarded as incompatible with
the Mendelian system, have since been shown to be in complete
accordancewith
it,
andtorevealfeaturesnoteasilyexplicable onany
otherview. The approximately normal distribution of the measure-
ments themselves may be deduced from the simple suppositionthat
the factors affecting human stature are approximately additive in
their effects. The correlations found between relatives of different
degreesofkinshipare,withintheirsamplingerrors,ofthemagnitudes
whichwouldbededucedfromthe assumptionthatthe measurement
is principally determined by inheritance, and that the factors con-
trolling it show, like most Mendelian factors, complete or almost
complete dominance. The presence of dominance is a Mendelian
feature, which is shown in the biometrical data by the well-estab-
lished fact that children of the same parents are, on the average,
somewhat more alike than are parent and offspring.

So farwe have merelyestablishedthe negative factthatthere are
no outstanding observations which require a blending system of
inheritance. There is, however, one group of modern researches
which, at least in the organisms investigated, seems to exclude it,
evenas a possibility. Incertainorganisms which are habitually self-
fertilized, as Johannsen was the first to show with a species of bean,
it is possible to establish so-called pure lines, within which heritable
variability is, apart from exceptional mutations, completely absent.

Within these lines the selection of the largest or the smallest beans,
evenwherethisselectionwascontinuedfortenortwentygenerations,
constantly produced offspring of the same average size. This size
differed from one line to another, showing that heritable variability
existedabundantlyinthespecies, andamongthethousandsofbeans
examined two distinct mutants were reported. If, however, any
appreciable fraction of the variance in bean size were ascribable to
elements which blend, the mutations necessary to maintain such
heritable variability would, in ten generations, have had time to
supply it almost to its maximum extent, and must inevitably have
been revealed by selection. Experiments of this type seem capable
of excluding the possibility that blending inheritance can account
for any appreciable fraction of the variance observed.

Nature and frequency of observed mutations

The assumptionthatthedirectionofevolutionarychangeisactually

governed by the direction in which mutations are occurring is not
easily compatible withthe nature of the numerous mutations which
havenowbeenobservedto occur. Forthemajorityoftheseproduce
strikingly disadvantageous deformities, and indeed muchthelargest
class are actually lethal. If we had to admit, as has been so often
assumed in theory, that these mutations point the direction of
evolution,theevolutionaryprospectsofthelittlefruit-flyDrosophila
would be deplorableindeed. Noris the position apparentlydifferent
withmanandhisdomesticatedanimalsand plants; asmaybejudged
from the frequency with which striking recessive defects, such as
albinism, deaf-mutism, and feebleness of mind in man, must have
occurred in the comparatively recent past, as mutations. Mutant
defects seemto attackthehuman eye asmuchasthatofDrosophila,
and in general the mutants which occur in domesticated races are
often monstrous and predominantly defective, whereas we know in
manycasesthattheevolutionarychangeswhichthesecreatureshave
undergone under human selection have been in the direction of a
manifest improvement.

In addition to the defective mutations, which by their con-
spicuousness attract attention, we may reasonably suppose that
otherless obvious mutations are occurring which, at least in certain
surroundings, orin certaingenetic combinations, might prove them-
selvestobebeneficial. Itwouldbeunreasonable,however,toassume
that such mutations appear individually with a frequency much
greater than that which is observed in the manifest defects. The
frequency of individual mutations in Drosophila is certainly seldom
greater than one in 100,000 individuals, and we may take this figure
to illustrate the inefficacy of any agency, which merely controls the
predominant direction of mutation, to determine the predominant
directionofevolutionary change. Forevenif selective survivalwere
totally absent, a lapse of time of the order of 100,000 generations
would be required to produce an important change with respect to
thefactorconcerned,intheheritablenatureofthespecies. Moreover,
if the mutant gene were opposed, even by a very minute selective
disadvantage, the change would be brought to a standstill at a very
early stage. The ideas necessary for a precise examination of the
nature of selective advantage will be developed in Chapter II but
;
itwillbereadilyunderstoodthatif we speakofaselective advantage
of one per cent., with the meaning that animals bearing one gene
haveanexpectationofoffspringonlyonepercent,greater thanthose
bearing its allelomorph, the selective advantage in question will be
a very minute one; at least in the sense that it would require an
enormous number of experimental animals, and extremely precise
methods of experimentation, to demonstrate so small an effect
experimentally. Such aselective advantage would, however, greatly
modify the genetic constitution of the species, not in 100,000 but in
100generations. If,moreover,we imaginethesetwo agenciesopposed
in their tendencies, so that a mutation which persistently occurs in
one in 100,000 individuals, is persistently opposed by a selective
advantage of only one per cent., it will easily be seen that an
equilibrium will be arrived at when only about one individual in
1,000 of the population will be affected by the mutation. This
equilibrium,moreover, willbe stable
;
forif we imagine that bysome
chance the number of mutants is raised to a higher proportion than
this, the proportion will immediately commence to diminish under
the action of selection, and evolution will proceed in the direction
contrary to the mutation which is occurring, until the proportion of
mutant individuals again reaches its equilibrium value. For muta-
tionstodominatethetrendofevolutionitisthusnecessarytopostu-
late mutation rates immensely greater than those which are known
to occur, and of an order of magnitude which, in general, would be
incompatible with particulate inheritance.

### Summary

The tacit assumption of the blending theory of inheritance led

Darwin, byaperfectlycogentargument, intoaseriesofspeculations,
respecting the causes of variations, and the possible evolutionary
effects of these causes. In particular the blending theory, by the
enormous mutation rates which it requires, led Darwin and others
to attach evolutionary importance to hypothetical agencies which
control the production of mutations. A mechanism (Mendelism) of
particulateinheritancehassincebeendiscovered,requiringmutations
toanextentlessbymanythousandfold. The 'pureline'experiments
seemtoexcludeblendinginheritanceevenasasubordinate
possibility.

The nature of the mutations observed is not compatible with the
view that evolution is directed by their means, while their observed
frequency of occurrence shows that an agency controlling mutations
wouldbe totallyineffectualingoverningthedirectionofevolutionary
change.

The whole group oftheories which ascribe to hypotheticalphysio-
logicalmechanisms, controllingthe occurrenceofmutations, apower
of directing the course of evolution, must be set aside, once the
blending theory of inheritance is abandoned. The sole surviving
theory is that of Natural Selection, and it would appear impossible
to avoid the conclusion that if any evolutionary phenomenon
appears to be inexplicable on this theory, it must be accepted at
present merely as one of the facts which in the present state of
knowledge seems inexplicable. The investigator who faces this fact,
as an unavoidable inference from what is now known of the nature
of inheritance, will direct his inquiries confidently towards a study
of the selective agencies at work throughout the life history of the
group in their native habitats, rather than to speculations on the
possible causes which influence their mutations. The experimental
study of agencies capable of influencing mutation rates is of the
highest interest for the light which it may throw on the nature of
these changes. We should altogether misinterpret the value of such
researches were we to regard them as revealing the causes of evolu-
tionary modification.

The life table
IN order to obtain a distinct idea of the application of Natural
Selection to all stages in the life-history of an organism, use may be
made of the ideas developed in the actuarial study of human mor-
tality. These ideas are not in themselves veryrecondite, but being
associated with the laborious computations and the technical nota-
tion employed in the practical business of life insurance, are not so
familiar as they might be to the majority of biologists. The text-
books on the subject,moreover, aredevotedto the chances of death,
and to monetary calculations dependent on these chances, whereas
in biological problems at least equal care and precision of ideas is
requisitewithrespecttoreproduction, and especiallytothecombined
action ofthesetwo agenciesin controllingthe increase or decrease of
the population.

The object of the present chapter is to combine certain ideas

in the form of a rigorous mathematical theorem, by which the rate

ment is determined by its present condition.

Thefundamentalapparatusoftheactuary'scraftiswhatis known
as a life table. This shows, for each year of age, of the population
considered, the proportion of persons born alive who live to attain
thatage. Forexample,alife table may show that the proportion of
personslivingtothe age of 20is 88 percent., while only 80percent.

reach the age of 40. It will be easily inferred that 12 per cent, of
those born alive dieinthe first 20years oflife, and 8percent, inthe
second 20 years. The life table is thus equivalent to a statement of
the frequency distribution ofthe age ofdeath inthe population con-
cerned. The amount by which each entry is less than the preceding
entry represents the number of deaths between these limits of age,
and this divided by the number living at the earlier age gives the
probabilityofdeathwithina
specified
timeofthoselivingatthatage.

Since the probability of death changes continuously throughout life,
the death rate at a given age can only be measured consistently by
taking the age interval to be infinitesimal. Consequently if lx is the
number living to age x, the death rate at age x is given by:
the logarithm being taken, asin most mathematical representations,
tobeontheNaturalorNaperiansystem. Thelifetablethuscontains
a statement of the death rates at all ages, and conversely can be
constructed from aknowledge of the course taken by the death rate
throughoutlife. Thisinfactistheordinary meansofconstructingthe
life tables inpractical use.

Itwillnotbenecessarytodiscussthetechnicalprocedureemployed
in the construction of life tables, the various conventions employed
inthis form ofstatement, northe difficulties whichariseintheinter-
pretation of the observational data available in practice for this
purpose. It will be sufficientto state only one point. Asin all other
experimental determinations of theoretical values, the accuracy
attainable in practice is limited by the extent of the observations ;
the result derived from any finite number of observations will be
liable to an error ofrandom sampling, but this fact does not, in any
degree, render such concepts as death rates or expectations of life
obscure or inexacjb. These are statements of probabilities, averages
&c., pertaining to the hypothetical population sampled, and depend
only upon its nature and circumstances. The inexactitude of our
in physics to dim our conception of that which we measure. These
conceptions would be equally clear if we were stating the chances of
death of a single individual of uniquegenetic constitution, orof one
exposed to an altogether transient and exceptional environment.

The life table, althoughitself averycomprehensive statement, is
stillinadequatetoexpressfullytherelationbetweenanorganismand

is necessary to introduce a second table giving rates of reproduction
in a manner analogous to the rates of death at each age. Just as a

a/ chance of dying within that interval measured by n>xdx, so the

as the chance of a person chosen at birth dying within a specified
interval of age dx is lxp>xdx, so the chance of such a person living to
reproduce in that interval will be lxbxdx.

thus withmankindwe naturallythinkofthe stageinthelife-history

x which with man represents this age, may in some cases be more
conveniently used to indicate rather the stage' in the life history
irrespective of chronological age, merelyto give greater vividness to
the meaning of the symbolism, but without altering the content of
the symbolical statements.

The Malthusian parameter ofpopulation increase
If we combine thetwotablesgivingthe rates ofdeathand repro-
duction, we may, still speaking in terms of human populations, at
once calculate the expectation of offspring of the newly-born child.

For the expectation of offspring in each element of age dx is lxbxdx,
and the sum of these elements over the whole of life will be the
totalexpectation of offspring. In mathematical terms this is
lxbxdx,
wheretheintegralisextendedfromzero,atbirth,toinfinity,tocover
every possible age at which reproduction might conceivably take
place. Ifatanyagereproductionceases absolutely, bxwillthereafter

The expectation ofoffspring determines whetherinthepopulation
concerned the reproductive rates are more or less than sufficient to
balance the existing death rates. If its value is less than unity the
reproductive rates are insufficient to maintain a stationary popula-
tion, in the sense that any population which constantly maintained
the death and reproduction rates in question would, apart from
temporary fluctuations, certainly ultimately decline innumbers at a
calculable rate. Equally, if it is greater than unity, the population
biologically speaking is more than holding its own, although the
actualnumberofheadstobecountedmaybetemporarilydecreasing.

if we note that corresponding to any system of rates of death and
reproduction,thereisonlyone possibleconstitutionofthepopulation

this system. For if the age distribution remains unchanged the
relative rate of increase or decrease of numbers at all ages must be

will also represent a decrease if is negative. Then, owing to the

m
the number is uniquely determined. But knowing the numbers

which births are now occurring can be calculated, and this can be
equatedtotheknownrate ofbirths appropriateto 0. In fact, the

be termed the Malthusian parameter of population increase. It
evidently supplies in its negative values an equally good measure of
population decrease, andso covers casestowhich, inrespectofman-
kind, Malthus paid too little attention.

In view of the close analogy between the growth of a population
supposed to follow the law of geometric increase, and the growth of
capital invested at compound interest, it is worth noting that if we

be entirely obscured or reversed by the crude comparison of the

the war, between 1911 and 1921, but the census of 1921 showed a
nominalincrease ofsome millions, andthat of 1931 will, doubtlessin
less degree, certainly indicate a further spurious period of increase,
due to the accumulation of persons at ages at which their reproduc-
tive value is negligible.

The genetic element in variance
Letusnowconsiderthemannerinwhichanyquantitativeindividual
measurement, such as human stature, may depend upon the indi-
We
vidual genetic constitution. may imagine, inrespect of any pair
of alternative genes, the population divided into two portions, each
comprising one homozygous type together with half of the hetero-
zygotes,
whichmustbedividedequallybetweenthetwo
portions.

The
difference in average stature between these two groups may then be
termed the average excess (in stature) associated with the gene sub-
stitution in question. This difference need not be wholly due to the
single gene, by which the groups are distinguished, but possibly also
to other genes statistically associated with it, and having similar
or opposite effects. This definition will appearthe more appropriate
if, as is necessaryfor precision, the population used to determine its
valuecomprises, notmerelythewholeofa speciesinanyonegenera-
tion attaining maturity, but is conceived to contain all the genetic
combinations possible, with frequencies appropriate to their actual
probabilities ofoccurrence and survival, whateverthesemaybe, and
if the average is based upon the statures attained by all these geno-
types in all possible environmental circumstances, with frequencies
appropriate to the actualprobabilities ofencounteringthese circum-
stances. The statistical concept of the excess in stature of a given
gene substitution will then be an exact one, not dependent upon
chance as must be any practical estimate of it, but only upon the
genetic nature andenvironmental circumstances of the species. The
excess in a factor will usually be influenced by the actual frequency
ratiop : q of the alternative genes, and may also be influenced, by
way of departures from random mating, by the varying reactions of
thefactorinquestionwith otherfactors itis for thisreasonthat its
;
value for the purpose of our argument is defined in the precise
statistical manner chosen, rather than in terms of the average sizes
ofpuregenotypes, aswouldbeappropriate in specifying suchavalue
inanexperimentalpopulation, inwhichmatingisundercontrol, and
in which the numbers of the different genotypes examinedis at the
choice of the experimenter.

For the same reasons it is also necessary to give a statistical
definition of a second quantity, which may be easily confused with
thatjustdefined, andmayoftenhaveanearlyequalvalue,yetwhich
must be distinguished from it in an accurate argument ; namely the
average effectproducedin the population asgenetically constituted.

by the substitution of the one type ofgenefortheother. Bywhat-
everrulesmating, and consequently the frequency of differentgene
combinations, may be governed, the substitutionof asmallpropor-
tionofthegenes of one kind by the genes ofanother will produce a
definiteproportionaleffectuponthe average stature. Theamount oi
thedifferenceproduced,ontheaverage,inthetotalstatureofthepopu-
lation, for each such gene substitution, may be termedthe average
effectjof suchsubstitution,incontra-distinctiontotheaverageexcess
as defined above. In human stature, for example, the correlation
foundbetween marriedpersons is sufficient to ensure that each gene
tending to increase the stature must bo associated with other genes
having a like effect, to an extent sufficient to make the average
excess associated with each gene substitution exceed its average
effect by about a quarter.

Ifaisthemagnitudeofthe average excessofanyfactor, and athe
magnitude ofthe averageeffectonthe chosen measurement, weshall
nowshowthatthecontributionofthatfactortothegeneticvariance
isrepresented by the expressionpqaa.

Thevariablemeasurementwillberepresentedbyre, andtherelation
of the quantities a to it may be made more clear by supposing that
foranyspecificgeneconstitutionwebuildupan*expected' value,X,
by adding together appropriate increments, positive or negative,
according to the natures of the genes present. This expected value
will not necessarily represent the real stature, though it may be a
good approximation to it, but its statistical properties will be more
intimately involved in the inheritance of real stature than the
properties of that variate itself. Since we are only concerned with
variationwe maytake as aprimaryingredient ofthevalue ofX,the
meanvalue ofxinthepopulation, and adjust ourpositive and nega-

actualvalues cannot but be qa and (pa) respectively.

The value of the average excess a of any gene substitution was
obtained by comparing the average values of the measurement xin
twomoietiesinto which thepopulation canbe divided. Itis evident
that the values of a will only be properly determined if the same
average differenceismaintainedinthesemoietiesbetweenthevalues

tions, x-X, is zero. This supplies a criterion mathematically

of this analysis, involving no difference of principle, leads to a
similarexpression for cases inwhich one or morefactors have more
than two different genes or allelomorphs present.

The appropriateness of the term genetic variance lies in the fact
X
thatthe quantity is determined solely by the genes presentinthe
individual, andis builtup of the average effects ofthese genes. It
therefore represents the genetic potentiality of the individual con-
cerned, in the aggregate of the mating possibilities actually open to
him, in the sense that the progeny averages (of x, as well as of X) of
two males mated with an identical series of representative females
will differ by exactly half as much as the genetic potentialities of
theirsiresdiffer. Relativegeneticvaluesmaythereforebedetermined
experimentally by the diallelmethod, in whicheach animaltestedis
mated to the same series of animals of the opposite sex, provided
that a large number of offspring can be obtained from each such
mating. Without obtaining individual values, the genetic variance
of the population may be derived from the correlations between
relatives, provided these correlations are accurately obtained. For
this purpose the square of the parental correlation divided by the
grandparentalcorrelationsupplies a good estimate of thefraction, of
the total observable variance of the measurement, which may be
regarded as genetic variance.

Itis clearthatthe actualmeasurements, x, obtainedinindividuals
may differ from their genetic expectations by reason of fluctuations
due to purelyenvironmentalcircumstances. It shouldbe noted that
this is not the only cause of difference, for even if environmental
fluctuations were entirely absent, and the actual measurements
therefore determined exactly by the genetic composition, these
measurements, which may be distinguished as genotypic, might still
differfromthegenetic values, X. A goodexample ofthis is afforded
by dominance, for if dominance is complete the genotypic value of
the heterozygote will be exactly the same as that of the correspond-
ing dominant homozygote, and yet these genotypes differ by agene
substitution which may materially affect the genetic potentiality
represented by X, and be reflected in the average measurement of
the offspring. A similar cause of discrepancy occurs when gene
substitutions in different factors are not exactly additive in their
averageeffects. The geneticvarianceasheredefinedisonlyaportion

Natural Selection
The definitions given above may be appliedto any characteristic
whatever; it is of special interest to apply them to the special
m
characteristic which measures the relative rate of increase or
decrease. The two groups of individuals bearing alternative genes,
and consequently the genes themselves, will necessarily either have
equal or unequal rates of increase, and the difference between the
m
appropriate values of will be represented by a, similarly the
m
average effect upon of the gene substitution will be represented
m
by a. Since measures fitness to survive by the objective fact of
representationinfuturegenerations,the quantitypqaawillrepresent
the contribution of each factor to the genetic variance in fitness;
the total genetic variance in fitness being the sum of these contribu-
tions, which is necessarily positive, or, in the limiting case, zero.

Moreover, anyincreasedp intheproportionofonetypeofgene atthe
expense of the other will be accompanied by an increase adp in the
average fitness of the species, where a may of course be negative;
butthedefinition ofa requires that the ratiop : q mustbeincreasing

If thereforethe time element dt is positive, the totalchange of fit-

the fundamental theorem of Natural Selection in the form
:
The rate ofincrease infitness of any organism at any time is equal
to its genetic variance infitness at that time.

The rigourof the demonstrationrequires thatthe terms employed
should be used strictly as defined ; the ease of its interpretation may
be increased by appropriate conventions of measurement. For
example, the ratio p : q should strictly be evaluated at any instant
by the enumeration, not necessarily of the census population, but of
all individuals having reproductive value, weighted according to the
reproductive value of each.

Since the theoremis exact onlyforidealizedpopulations, in which
fortuitous fluctuations in genetic composition have been excluded,
it is important to obtain an estimate of the magnitude of the effect
of these fluctuations, or in other words to obtain a standard error
appropriate to the calculated, or expected, rate of increase in
fitness. It will be sufficient for this purpose to consider the special
case of a population mating and reproducing at random. It is
easy to see that if such chance fluctuations cause a difference $p
between the actual value of p obtained in any generation and that
expected, the variance of $p will be
where n represents the number breeding in each generation, and 2n
therefore is the number of genes in the n individuals which live to
replacethem. Thevariance oftheincreaseinfitness, ap, duetothis
cause, will therefore be
and since,withrandom mating,thechancefluctuationinthedifferent
gene ratios will be independent, and the values of a and a are no
longer distinct,it follows that, on this condition, the rate ofincrease
of fitness, when measured over one generation, will have a standard
error due to random survival equal to
whereT isthetime ofa generation. Itwillusuallybe convenientfor
each organism to measure time in generations, and if this is done it
will be apparent from the large factor 2n in the denominator, that
the random fluctuations in W, even measured over only a single
generation,maybeexpectedtobeverysmallcomparedtotheaverage
rate ofprogress. The regularity ofthelatteris infactguaranteedby
the same circumstance which makes a statistical assemblage of

billionsofmolecules, andthiswouldbeacomparativelylarge number

same. Interpreted exactly, the formula shows that it is only when
the rate of progress, W, when time is measured in generations, is
itself so small as to be comparable to IIn, that the rate of progress
achieved in successive generations is made to be irregular. Even if
an equipoise of this order of exactitude, between the rates of death
and reproductionofdifferentgenotypes,wereestablished, itwouldbe
onlythe rate of progress for spans of a single generation that would
be shown to be irregular, and the deviations from regularity over a
span of 10,000 generations would be just a hundredfold less.

It will be noticed that the fundamental theorem proved above
bears some remarkable resemblances to the second law of thermo-
dynamics. Both are properties of populations, or aggregates, true
irrespective ofthe nature oftheunits which composethem both are
;
statistical laws ; each requires the constant increase of a measurable
quantity, inthe one case theentropyof a physical system andinthe
other the fitness, measured by m, of a biological population. As in
the physical world we can conceive of theoretical systems in which
dissipative forces are wholly absent, and in which the entropy con-
sequently remains constant, so we can conceive, thoughwe need not
expect to find, biological populations in which the genetic variance
is absolutelyzero, and in which fitness does not increase. Professor
Eddingtonhasrecentlyremarkedthat 'Thelawthatentropy always
increases the second law of thermodynamics holds, I think, the
supremepositionamongthelawsofnature
'.

Itisnotalittleinstruc-
tivethatsosimilaralawshouldholdthesupremepositionamongthe
biological sciences. While it is possible that both may ultimately be
absorbed by some more general principle, for the present we should
note that the laws as they stand present profound differences
(1) The systems considered in thermodynamics are permanent;
species on the contrary are liable to extinction, although biological
improvement must be expectedto occurup to the end of their exis-
tence. (2) Fitness, although measured by a uniform method, is
qualitativelydifferentforeverydifferent organism, whereasentropy,
like temperature, is taken to have the same meaning for all physical
systems. (3) Fitness maybeincreasedordecreasedbychangesinthe
environment, without reacting quantitatively upon that environ-
ment. (4) Entropy changes are exceptional in the physical world in
being irreversible, while irreversible evolutionary changes form no
exception amongbiologicalphenomena. Finally, (5)entropychanges
lead to a progressive disorganization of the physical world, at least
from the human standpoint of the utilization of energy, while evolu-
tionary changes are generally recognized as producing progressively
higher organization in the organic world.

The statement of the principle ofNaturalSelection in the form of
atheorem determining the rate of progress of a species in fitnessto
survive (this term being used for a well-defined statistical attribute
of the population), together with the relation between this rate of
progress and its standard error, puts us in a position to judge of the
validity of the objection which has been made, that the principle of
NaturalSelectiondependsonasuccessionoffavourablechances. The

more appropriatetothehopesofthepatronsofhisestablishment. It
is easy without any very profound logical analysis to perceive the
difference between a succession of favourable deviations from the

The nature of adaptation
Inordertoconsiderinoutlinetheconsequencestotheorganicworld
oftheprogressive increase offitness ofeach species of organism, it is
necessarytoconsidertheabstractnatureoftherelationship whichwe
term 'adaptation'. This is the more necessary since any simple
example of adaptation, such as the lengthened neck and legs of the
giraffe as an adaptation to browsing on high levels of foliage, or the
conformity in average tint of an animal to its natural background,
lose, bytheverysimplicityofstatement, agreatpartofthe meaning
whichtheword
reallyconveys.

Forthemorecomplextheadaptation,
the more numerous the different features of conformity, the more
essentially adaptive the situation is recognized to be. An organism
is regarded as adapted to a particular situation, or to the totality of
situations which constitute its environment, only in so far as we can
imagine an assemblage of slightly different situations, or environ-
ments, to whichthe animalwould onthe whole be lesswell adapted
;
and equallyonlyinsofaraswecanimagineanassemblageofslightly
different organic forms, which would be less well adapted to that
environment. This I take to be the meaning which the word is
intended to convey, apart altogether from the question whether
organisms really are adapted to their environments, or whether the
structures and instincts to which the term has been applied are
rightly so described.

The statistical requirements of the situation, in which one thing is
made to conform to another in a large number of different respects,
may be illustrated geometrically. The degree of conformity may be
represented by the closeness with which a point A approaches a
fixed point 0. In space of three dimensions we can only represent
conformity in three different respects, but even with only these the
general character of the situation may be represented. The possible
positions representing adaptations superior to that represented by
A will be enclosed by a sphere passing through A and centred at O.

If A isshiftedthroughafixeddistance, r, inanydirectionitstransla-
tion will improve theadaptation ifitis carriedto apointwithinthis
sphere, but will impair it if the new position is outside. If r is very
small it may be perceived that the chances of these two events are
approximatelyequal, andthechanceofanimprovementtendstothe

sphereorgreater,thereisno longeranychancewhateverofimprove-
ment,forallpointswithinthe sphere arelessthanthisdistancefrom

improvement is
where d is the diameter of the sphere.

The chance of improvement thus decreases steadily from its

The representationinthreedimensionsisevidentlyinadequate for
;
even a single organ, in cases in which we know enough to appreciate
the relation between structure andfunction, as is, broadly speaking,
the case with the eye in vertebrates, often shows this conformity in
many more than three respects. It is of interest therefore, that if in
ourgeometrical problem the number of dimensions be increased, the
form of the relationship between the magnitude of the change r and

The conformity of these statistical requirements with common

may first be considered, since their consequences in this connexion
are ofanextremelysimplecharacter. A considerablenumberofsuch
mutations have now been observed, andthese are, I believe, without
exception, either definitely pathological (most often lethal) in their
effects, or with high probability to be regarded as deleterious in the
wildstate. Thisismerelywhatwouldbeexpectedontheview, which

inanotherwaywemaysaythateachmutationofthiskindisallowed
tocontributeexactlyas muchtothegenetic variance offitnessinthe
species as will provide a rate of improvement equivalent to the rate
of deterioration caused by the continual occurrence of the mutation.

As to the physical environment, geological and climatological
changes must always beslowlyinprogress, andthese,thoughpossibly
beneficial to some few organisms, must as they continue become
harmfulto the greaternumber, for the same reasons as mutations in
the organism itself will generally be harmful. For the majority of
organisms, therefore, the physical environment may be regarded as
constantlydeteriorating, whethertheclimate,forexample, is becom-
ing warmer or cooler, moister or drier, and this will tend, in the
majority of species, constantly to lower the average value of m, the
Malthusian parameter of the population increase. Probably more
important than the changes in climate will be the evolutionary
changes in progress in associated organisms. As each organism
increases in fitness, so will its enemies and competitors increase in
fitness and this will have the same effect, perhaps in a much more
;
important degree, in impairing the environment, from the point of
view of each organism concerned. Against the action of Natural
Selectionin constantlyincreasing the fitness of every organism, at a
rate equal to the genetic variance in fitness which that population
maintains, istobesetofftheveryconsiderableitemofthedeteriora-

increase in population, while in the reverse case the population will
certainly decrease.

oversimplification to assert that the environment determines the

must indeed be determined by the elastic quality of the resistance
offeredto increase innumbers, so that life is made somewhat harder
toeachindividualwhenthepopulationislarger, andeasierwhenthe

increase in the mean value of ra produced by Natural Selection, is
deducted the rate of decrease due to deterioration in environment,

A word should perhaps be said as to the form of statement of
selection theory which ascribes the 'struggle for existence' to the
excessive production of offspring,supposedlytobeobservedthrough-
out organicnature. If the numbers of a species are adjusted to that
level at which each adult produces on the average just two offspring
which attainthe adult state, then, ifthere is any mortality whatever
in the previous life stages, either through inorganic causes, or by
reason of predators and parasites, it necessarily follows that young
mustbeproducedinexcessoftheparentalnumbers. Ifthe mortality
is high, then the ratio of this excess will be large. Having realized
this situation, if we now imagine an ideal world in which all these
offspringattainmaturityandbreed,itisobviousthatinsuchaworld
the numbers of the species considered will increase without limit. It
is usually added,thoughthis is logically irrelevant, that the increase
willbeingeometricalprogression. We mayinthissensespeakofthe
production of offspring as 'excessive', and the geometrical rate of
increase with its impressive picture of over-population, has been
widely represented as a logical basis of the argument for natural
selection. However, it shouldbe remembered that the production of
offspringis onlyexcessive inrelation to an imaginary world, and the
'high geometrical rate of increase' is only attained by abolishing a
real death rate, while retaining a real rate of reproduction. There is
something like a relic of creationist philosophy in arguing from the
observation, let us say, that a cod spawns a million eggs, that there-
fore its offspring are subject to Natural Selection; and it has the
disadvantage ofexcluding fecundityfrom the class of characteristics
of which we may attempt to appreciate the aptitude. It would be
instructivetoknownotonlybywhat
mechanisma
apportionmentis
madebetweenthenutrimentdevotedtothegonads
andthat devotedto the rest ofthe parentalorganism, but also what
circumstances in the life-history and environment would render
profitable the diversion of a greater or lesser share of the available
resourcestowardsreproduction. ThehistoricalfactthatbothDarwin
and Wallacewereledthroughreading Malthus's essay on population
to appreciate the efficacy of selection, though extremely instructive
as to the philosophy of their age, should no longer constrain us to
confuse the consequences of that principle with its foundations.

It will have been apparent in the earlier sections of this chapter
that the actuarial information necessary for the calculation of the
geneticchangesactuallyinprogressinapopulationoforganisms, will
always be lacking if only becausethe numberof differentgenotypes
;
for each of which the Malthusian parameter is required will often,
perhaps always, exceed the number of organisms in the population,
in additiontothefactthatthisparameterisveryimperfectly known
even in human population aggregates, for which vital statistics are
insome degree available. If, however, we arecontenttoconsidernot
infull detailexactly what changes are in progress, but quite broadly
to what extent an organism is holding its own in the economy of
nature, it is only necessary to d M etermine the numerical values of the
four quantities W, D, C, and which enter into the equation of
,
populationgrowth. Our ignorance astothese is, ofcourse, profound,
but, regarding the problem in this limited aspect, it is by no means
obvious, withrespecttoorganismsofsufficientimportancetodeserve
detailed study, that it could not largely be removed by systematic
and well-directed observations. The quantity C, for example, which
isa period oftime, measuring the facility with which, with increased
fitness, the population is allowed to increase, must be intimately
related to the course of population increase or decrease, with which
the numbers of an organism exposed to new influences, approach an
equilibrium value, which over short periods may be regarded as
stationary. An organism introduced into a new environment, to
whichitiswellsuited, willincreaseinnumbers rapidlyforacompara-
tively few years, andsomewhat rapidlyattainitsequilibriumdensity.

The same must be true of the decrease of a population exposed by
man to new causes of destruction. In these cases it is probable
that the process of attaining equilibrium is sufficiently rapid for the
changes due to organic evolution, and the natural deterioration of
theenvironment,tobeneglected, andfurtherchangesintheextentof
human intervention could, for experimental purposes, be suspended
locally. In such cases, at their simplest, the M course of population
c M hange would berepresented bythe equation = Ae~t/ G , or, since
is the relative or logarithmic growth rate of the population, by

tion, andNOthe steadyvalue towhichitistending. Observations of
N
will then determine, at least approximately, the value of the time
constant C. It should be noticed that for such comparatively large
changes of population density as could be measured with sufficient
precision, important changes willoftentake place inthe numbers of
associated organisms. The simple relation obtained above will only
be satisfactory if these associated changes take place rapidly in
comparison to the change we are studying. Otherwise it would be
necessary to take account by direct observation of the changes in
numbers of at least the more important of the associated organisms,
and so to determine the constants of the more complex system of
differentialequationsbywhichtheirinteractionsmayberepresented.

With respecttotheotherconstants,thepracticaldifficultiesappear
to be greater, though, seeing how little attention in general has been
paidtothe quantitative study oforganismsintheirnaturalhabitats,
itwouldberashtoassumethattheirdeterminationisbeyond human
endeavour. Though it would be out of place here to outline a pro-
gramme of research, it is perhaps worth while to indicate a few
possibilities. The density of populations of animals and plants may
bestudiedinrelationtothe climatic andotherenvironmentalfactors
oftheirhabitats. Knowledgeofthiskind,evenifonlyapproximately
complete, would indicate to what extent physical changes now in
progress can be improving or impairing the environment. If the
constant C is also known, these effects may be translated directly
into terms of fitness. In certain cases, such as M the slow changes in
composition of plant associations, the value of might be directly
determined, and in conjunction with more or less trustworthy deter-
minationsofCand 7),thiswouldleadtoamoreorlessexactestimate
of the evolutionary factor W. The direct determination of the latter
quantity would seem to require a complete genealogy of the species
for several generations, and this will only be possible in Man. More-
over, owingtotherapidchangeswhichman ismakinginhisenviron-
ment, it may be foreseen that human genealogies on a national or
international scale, such as has been undertaken in Sweden, while
throwing an immense amount of light on the current conditions of
human reproduction and survival, will offerspecial difficulties in the
determination and interpretation of the evolutionary value W.

values of individuals at all ages or stages of their life-history. The
Malthusian parameter will in general be different for each different
genotype, and will measure the fitness to survive of each.

The variation in a population of any individual measurement is
specified quantitatively by its variance, and of this, taking account
of the genetic composition of all possible individuals, a definite
amount may be recognized as genetic variance.

The rate of increase of fitness of any speciesis equaltothe genetic
varianceinfitness, andthestandarderrorofthisrateofprogress even
over a single generation, will (unless the latter is so exceedingly
minute as to be comparable, when time is measured in generations,
to the reciprocal of the number of organisms in the population) be
small compared to the rate of progress.

the magnitude of the change is increased. The intensity of adapta-
tion is inversely proportionalto a standard magnitude of change for
which this probability is constant. Thus the larger the change, or
the more intense the adaptation, the smaller will be the chance of
improvement.

The dominance of wild genes

IThasbeenseeninChapterIthatitisscarcelypossible,inthe

light
of the participate nature of inheritance, to ascribe to mutations any
importance in determining the direction of evolutionary change
;
their importance in evolution lies in playing the very different role
ofmaintainingthe stock ofgenetic variance at a certain level, which
level in its turn is a factor in determining the speed, though not the
direction, ofevolutionary progress. Before attempting to considerin
detail the relations between the amount of the stock of genetic
variability in a species, the rates of mutation, and the size of the
population, as willbe done inChapterIV, itisnecessaryto examine,
as far as the present state of the evidence allows, into the character
ofthegenetic changes known as mutations.

It will certainly be felt by some, especially by those to whom the
relevant evidence is still to a large extent unfamiliar, that at the
present timeitis altogetherpremature to put forward, as abasis for
furtherargument,atheoryoftheevolutionofdominance seeingthat,
;
until quite recently, dominance was accepted by geneticists as an
unexplained fact which, in our ignorance of its causes, could be
dismissed aswithout theoreticalimportance. Nevertheless, it would
scarcely have been defensible to develop a theory of the role of
mutations in evolution, without regard to the cases of mutations
A
actually observed. study of these changes reveals a body of
evidence, concordant so far as it goes, though far less complete than
it will doubtless soon become, now that attentionhas been drawn to
thesubject it will scarcely be thought wrong, therefore, to put
;
before the reader both the salient points of the evidence, and my
inferences from them. The statement of the evidence is entirely
provisional, and will, I hope, before long be largely superseded by
more direct and complete observation ; whilst my theory will, I be-
lieve, appear under examination to be at present sufficiently well
founded to serve as aguide to the direction of ourfurtherinquiries.

The validity of later Chapters will not be impugned, though their
relevance will be, if I am wrong in the inferences drawn in this
Chapter.

Thetermmutationhasbeenappliedtoanumberofdifferentkinds
ofintracellularevents, havingincommontheproductionofheritable
novelties. Cases areknownofthedoublingofthe entirechromosome
outfit, the doubling of single chromosomes, and of parts of chromo-
somes in other cases a part of a chromosome appears to be trans-
;
located from its habitual site and attached to some other chromo-
some ; and these are allmutationsinthewideand primitive meaning
of the term. Nevertheless, the evolutionary possibilities of these
kinds of change are evidently extremely limited compared to those
of the type of change to which the term gene-mutation is applied.

This consists in achange in a single hereditaryparticle, orgene, into
a gene of a new type, occupying the same locus in the germinal
structure. The grosser forms of mutation may indeed play a special
evolutionary role in supplying a mechanism of reproductive incom-
patibility, which may be of importance when physiological isolation
is in question, but only in very special cases could they contribute
appreciably to the genetic diversity of an interbreeding population.

With respect to any pair of alternative or allelomorphic genes,
theonemaybedistinguished fromtheotherinfourdifferentrespects,
which, in order to examine their relationships, it is important to
keep conceptually distinct. We may distinguish (a) the rarer from
the more common, (6) the less advantageous from the more advan-
tageous, (c) the mutantgene fromthe relativelyprimitive gene from
which it arose, and finally (d) the recessive gene from the dominant.

Itisonly whenthesefourmeansofcontrastarekeptdistinctthatwe
can appreciate the associations between them which arise from
different causes.

In connexion with the nature of adaptation it has been seen that
mutantgeneswillmore oftenthannotbe disadvantageous, andthat
thiswillbemostconspicuouslythecasewiththefactorshavingalarge
effect, andwhichconsequently are more easily detected andstudied.

Distinctions (6) and (c) are thus closely associated. Moreover, in a
freely mixing population, butnotin an aggregate ofgenotypes kept
as separate breeds, the less advantageousgeneswilltendtobecome
the rarer, and ifthis tendency is checked at anypointby occasional
mutations, suchmutantandlessadvantageousgeneswillatthesame
timegenerally betherarer. Finally, if we supposeprovisionallythat
the mutant genes are dominant just as often as they are recessive,
selection will be far more severe in eliminating the disadvantageous
dominants than in eliminating the disadvantageous recessives. This
may be seen most easily by considering cases of equal rarity of the
two types. If 1 gene in 100 represents a dominant defect, each
10,000 of the population will contain on the average 199 defectives,
exposedtounfavourableselection,whereasif 1genein 100represents
a recessive defect, the defect will appear on the average in only 1 in
10,000. Consequently, the rare recessive is much sheltered from the
action ofselection, andin such apopulation we mightexpectto find
many cases of rare recessive defects (a, b, d), and but few rare
dominant defects. The fact that the rare recessives exposed by
inbreeding prove themselves to be defective does not then demon-
stratethatmutantdefectsaregenerallyrecessive. Ontheotherhand,
ifevolutionhad proceededbystepscomparableinsizewiththeeffects
of factors which it is convenient to study, one might expect to find
among the rare recessives a few primitive genes superseded in the
bulkofthepopulationbymoreadvantageousgeneswhichhadarisen
from them by mutation. Such cases appeartobe entirelyunknown;
wemayinterpretthisasindicatingeitherthattheevolutionarysteps
are not ordinarily so large as the effects of the factors which we can
study, or that the mutant gene is rarely or never completely domi-
nant to its predecessor. Since I believe both statements to be true,
it is not permissible to use this observation to prove either.

Among species of plants propagated, like sweet peas, in distinct
varieties, genetical analysis shows that the genes which on morpho-
logical grounds must be regarded as mutants, are, in an immense
preponderance, recessives. In sweet peas complete recessiveness
seems to be the invariablerule, as judgedfrom the fifteen ortwenty
factors so far successfully elucidated. In the majority of such cases
the occurrence of the mutation has not itself been observed, but the
mutant gene is recognized as such by producing effects unknown
in the older varieties, or wild prototypes. This is very substantial
and extensive evidence of the tendency of mutant genes to be
recessive, for dominant mutants would be as eagerly seized upon
and perpetuated as novelties, and would be more quickly detected
than are recessives. The greater ease of detectionis especiallyto be
emphasizedinthecaseofMan, wheretherecognitionofararedefect
as due to a single Mendelian factor depends upon genealogical
evidence ; for the simplest pedigree, such as is almost always avail-
able, will reveal the character of a dominant defect, while the colla-
tion of the statistical evidence of extensive pedigree collections is
usually necessary to demonstrate the Mendelian character of a
simple recessive. For example, the Mendelian character even of
albinism in Man has been disputed. Inconsequence ofthis difficulty
it is probable that more dominant defects are known in Man than
recessives, although there can be no doubt that the great bulk of
human

defects,physical

andmental,are,asinotheranimals,recessive.

This view is confirmed by the fact that sex-linked mutants, which
a priori in an organism with 24 pairs of chromosomes should be
a small minority, are prominent in the list of human defects; here
the recessives are nearly as easily detected as dominants, and all
knowncasesarerecessive. Further, inthecase ofso-calleddominant
defects in Man we only know that the heterozygote differs from the
normal; we cannot ordinarily know what is the appearance of the
homozygote mutant, or even ifitis viable.

The imposingbody ofgeneticalresearchesdevotedto the fruit-fly,
Drosophila, in this as in other genetical questions has supplied the
most decisive evidence. Something like 500 mutants have been
actually observed in cultures of this fly, and, setting aside the large
class of lethals, and all those which produce no visible effect, there
remain 221 cases inwhichwe can classify the mutation asRecessive,
Intermediate, or, as it is usuallycalled, IncompletelyDominant, or
finally completely Dominant. The table shows the distribution into
thesethree classes, respectively forthe autosomalandthe sex-linked
mutations.

The classification has been compiled from the magnificent article
on Drosophila in Bibliographica Genetica. In several individual
instances my classification may be mistaken, either because the
observations are affected by some uncertainty, or because they are
not in every case explicitly stated. No one will doubt the extreme
thoroughnesswithwhichthegeneticsofthisfly hasbeen investigated;
it is, however, perhaps worth mentioning that whereas recessives
are so commonthatthelossofonewithoutinvestigation would seem
no greattragedy, mutationswhichcanbe *usedasadominant ', that
is the Intermediates, are of the greatest service to further research,
and are much valued. They are, moreover, exposed to detection
immediately upon their occurrence, whereas recessives are only
noticed when they appear as homozygotes. For both reasons the
proportionofrecessives, highasitis, islikelyto be anunderestimate
of the actual frequency of occurrence.

Lethal factors, which have been excluded from the enumeration
set out above, provide independent though slightly equivocal con-
firmationofthesameconclusion. The majorityofso-calleddominants
are lethal in the homozygous condition, and must for this reason be
properlyclassedasIntermediate. Itismoreremarkablethatrecessive
lethals, which can produce no visible changes, were soon discovered
bytheireffectindisturbingthefrequencyratiosofotherfactors, and
especiallyofsex. Ithassincebeendemonstratedthatbothinnormal
conditions, andwhenmutationsareartificially stimulatedbyX-rays,
the recessive lethals are by far the most frequent class of mutation.

Somethingliketwopercent, ofuntreatedfruit-fliesmustbe mutants
for some recessive lethal, and the frequency of mutations of this
class must be quite tenfold that of all visible mutations. Whereas,
among the latter, one in seventeen has been classed as inter-
mediate inrespect of dominance, theproportion must be even lower
among lethals, unless indeed some of the obscure, though probably
large,classofmutantswhicharelethalwhen heterozygous,becounted
asdominant.

The pronounced tendency of the mutant gene to be recessive, to
the gene of wild type from which it arises, calls for explanation, and
thereisfortunately animportantgroup ofobservations available, to
show that in this connexion we should stress the prevalence in the
wildstateofthedominant gene,ratherthanitsrelationofpredecessor
to the mutant which arises from it. Numerous cases are now known
inwhich severaldifferent mutations have occurredto the same gene,
and each of the mutant types can replace each other, and the wild
type, inthe same locus. Inrodents, forexample, severalmembers of
the albino series of genes have been found, ranging in effect from
a slight dilution of pigmentation to its complete suppression. Using
a set of five such alternative genes in the eavy or guinea pig, Sewall
Wright has formed all of the fifteen possible combinations, five
homozygous and ten heterozygous, which a set of five allelomorphs
make possible. These he has examined in sufficient numbers to
determine the average, and normal variation in depth of pigment
both of the areas which range from black through sepia to white,
and those which range from red through yellow. The four hetero-
zygous forms containing the wild type gene are indistinguishable in
depth ofpigmentfrom thehomozygous wildtype, fromwhichallthe
other four homozygotes differ considerably. The remaining six
heterozygous forms, which contain no gene of the wild type, all are
clearly intermediate in both colours between the two homozygotes
for the genes which they contain. This case, remarkable for the
thoroughness with which it has been examined, is by no means
exceptional. A number of similar series have been found in Droso-
phila, and the rule that the wild type gene dominates allothers, but
that theseothersshownomutual dominance, is stated as general by
Morgan, Bridges, and Sturtevant.

The exceptional position in respect to dominance of the genes of
the wild type among their allelomorphs is not owing to their
beingthe originals from which the others arose by mutation, for one
mutant allelomorph has been observed to arise from another, and
mutant genes to mutate back to the wild type. We are driven
therefore to seein dominance acharacteristic proper, not to the pre-
decessorasopposedtothesuccessorinaseriesofmutationalchanges,
but to the prevalent wild type as opposed to its unsuccessful com-
petitors. Moreover, unless we are to abandon altogether the evolu-
tionary conception of the modification of species by the occasional
substitution of one gene for the predecessor from which it arose, the
existence oftherule which gives genetical dominance to genes of the
prevalent wild type requires that the successful new gene should in
somewaybecomedominanttoitscompetitors, and ifbackmutations
occur,toitspredecessoralso. Themeansbywhichthiscanoccurare

in Chapter II, itis scarcely possibletoimagineaproblemmore intri-
cate, or requiring so inconceivably detailed a knowledge of the
bionomic situation, as that of tracing the net gain in fitness of any
particular genetic change. Our knowledge in this respect, while
sufficient to enable us to appreciate the adaptive significance of the
differencesinorganization which distinguish wholeordersorfamilies,
isalmostalwaysinadequatetoputasimilarinterpretation on
specific
differences, and still more on intraspecific variation. This circum-
stance, which has been felt as a difficulty to the theory of Natural
Selection by writers such as Bateson (1894) and Robson (1927),
while admitting of notable exceptions, such as external colour, and
especiallythe mimetic patterns of butterflies, doesyetgive an added
interest to a case in which our quantitative information, while far
from exact, is yet substantial and approximate.

Modification of the effects of Mendelian factors
The fashion ofspeaking of a givenfactor, or gene substitution, as
causing a given somatic change, which was prevalent among the
earlier geneticists, has largely given way to a realization that the
change, although genetically determined, may be influenced or
governed either by the environment in which the substitution is
examined,orbytheotherelementsinthegeneticcomposition. Cases
were fairly early noticed in which a factor, J5, produced an effect
when a second factor, A, was represented by its recessive gene, but
not when the dominant gene was present. Factor A was then said
B
to be epistatic to factor B, or more recently would be said to be
a specific modifier of A. There are other cases in which neither A
nor B produce any effect when the other is recessive, in which cases
we speak of the two factors as complementary; again neither may
produce any effect if the other is dominant, when we speak of the
twofactorsasduplicate. Theseareevidentlyonlyparticularexamples
ofthe more generalfact that the visible effect of agene substitution
depends both on the gene substitution itself and on the genetic
complex, or organism, in which this gene substitution is made. We
may perhaps find a form ofwords whichreduces to a minimum the
discrepancy between the complexity ofthe actual relationships, and
the simplicity of those presupposed by ordinary grammatical forms,
by speaking of the observed somatic change as the reaction of the

There are several cases in which such modification has been
observed to occur in experimental stocks. It has been rather fre-
quently observed, whenanew and sharply distinct mutant in Droso-
phila has been put aside to breed in stock bottles for some genera-
tions, thatwhen itisrequiredagainforuse,themutantformappears
to be appreciably less distinctfromthe wildtype thanithad atfirst
seemed. The reality of this tendency to revert to the wild form, as
well as its cause, has been demonstrated in several cases by the
simple but crucial experiment of mating the modified mutants to
unrelated wild stock, and, from the hybrid, extracting the mutant
form by inbreeding. The mutantform so recoveredis found to have
regained much of its original intensity; and thus shows that the
modificationhasnotbeenduetoanychangeinthemutant gene, but
to a change in the genetic complex of the organism with which it
reacts. This change is now open to a simple explanation. The flies
from which the stock was formed were variable in genetic qualities
which affectedthe violence of their reaction to the mutant gene. In
the competitive conditions of the stock bottle those hereditary units
which favoured a mild reaction produced flies less defective than
theircompetitors, andtheselectionofthesemodifyingfactorsrapidly
modified the average intensity of the reaction to the mutant gene,
and consequently its average divergence in appearance from the

a mutation in a number of individuals breedingpreferentially from
the least defective, is thus to modify the organism in such a way as
to mitigate the disadvantageous effects of the mutation. It is not
onlythe frequency of a gene, but the reaction of the organism to it,
whichisatthe mercyofNaturalSelection. To understandtheeffect
of a gene on members of a given population, that is, the reaction of
such organisms to it, we must consider what part that gene has
playedintheir ancestry.

The greatmajority, ifnot all, ofthe mutations which we canhope
to observe inexperimental culture must, unless these mutations can
be ascribed to our cultural methods, have occurred in the history of
the speciesinenormousnumbers
:
many oftheDrosopkilamutations
have occurred repeatedly in culture, and, large as the numbers
observed have been, they are trifling compared to the total ancestry
of any individual wild fly. Our knowledge of the frequency of
individual mutations is at present slender; but it is sufficient to
establish that many mutations must occur with a frequency of 1 in
100,000, or 1 in 1,000,000; and, indeed,the probabilityofmutations
much rarer than this appearing in cultures is extremely small. We
have, of course, no direct knowledge ofthe mutation rates prevalent
innature, but whathas beendiscoveredsofarofthe causes affecting
mutationrategives nogroundforsupposingthattheyarelowerthan
in the laboratory. As to the extent of the ancestry of an individual
fly over which a given mutation has been liable to occur, we have
good grounds for assuming that it may often be longer than the
separateexistenceofspecifictypes
;
fordifferentspeciesofDrosophila
have shown several mutations which can be identified by hybridi-
zation. Beyond this, direct tests of identity fail us ; but it is not an
unreasonable conjecture that such a mutation as albinism, which
appears in mammals of the most diverse orders, has been occurring
in the ancestry of the group from its earliest beginnings. On the
otherhand, as will be seen below, we have reason for believing that,
with the evolution of new species, new mutations do sometimes
commence to occur, or at least to occur with appreciable frequency.

Modification of the heterozygote
When an unfavourable mutation persists in occurring in every
generation once, let us say, in each million chromosomes, it will, of
course, be kept rare by selection; but it will, on the other hand,
affectmanyindividualswho arepotentialancestors offuturegenera-
tions, in addition to those who are actually mutants. An important
consequence of its rarity is that both these classes will be hetero-
zygotes farmore frequentlythan they will be homozygotes. Ifp is
therelativefrequencyinthepopulationofmutanttowild-typegenes,
the three classes of individuals, non-mutant, heterozygote and
homozygousmutantwillappearinthe ratio 1 : 2p : p2 , sothateven
if p were as large as one-thousandth, the heterozygotes would be
2,000timesasnumerousasthemutanthomozygotes. A consequence
ofthisis that, solong as the heterozygote differsfrom the wildtype
appreciably in fitness to survive, the relative numbers of the three
classeswillbedetermined, foragivenmutationrate, bythe selective
disadvantage of the heterozygote, and to no appreciable extent by
theselectivedisadvantage, orevencompletelethality, ofthe mutant
homozygote.

For our present purpose we take as the relative fitness of the
heterozygote, denoted by v, the ratio which the average number of
offspring of this type bears to the average from non-mutant indivi-
duals. Thenitis easyto see thatthefractionpwillbe diminishedin
each generation by the quantityp(l -v) and, so long as p is small,
will be augmented by the quantity k representing the actual muta-
tion rate. An equilibrium will therefore be established between the
agencies of mutation and selection when
p(l v) k.

If, to take one extreme, v is a small fraction, thenp is little greater
than k, little greater, for example, than 1 in 1,000,000, and at this
extreme the heterozygotes will occur 2,000,000 times as frequently
as the mutant homozygotes. If v is J, p will be twice k, and the
heterozygotes will still be a million times the more frequent. If on
the other hand the viability and generalfitness of theheterozygoted
aresogoodthatitisonlyata 1percent, disadvantage, andv = 0-99,
the heterozygotes will still be 20,000 times the more frequent.

Theseveryhighratiosjustifytheconclusionthatiftheheterozygote
is at any appreciable disadvantage comparedto the wild type, itwill
be so enormously more frequent than the homozygote that any
selection of modifiers which is in progress will be determined by the
reaction of the heterozygote.

Two othercircumstances serve toincreasethe disproportion ofthe
selective effects. In the first place, the efficacy of the selection in
modifyingthe characteristics of the species depends not only upon
the frequency of the individuals selected, but upon their chance of
leaving a remote posterity. In fact we need to evaluate not the
relative numbers of the two types in any one generation, but the
proportions they represent of the total ancestry of a distant sub-
sequentgeneration. Evidently,if, asistobeanticipated,theviability
of the homozygous mutant is lower than that of the heterozygote,
the latter will count for more in future generations, and even if
the two types had equal viability, the heterozygote is still at an
advantage, for mated with wild type only half his offspring will be
heterozygous, while in a similar case all the offspring of the homo-
zygote will be equally handicapped.

Thispointbecomesofimportancewithsex-linkedfactors,wherethe
mutanttypemalesandtheheterozygousfemalesdonotdiffergreatly
infrequency, but maydiffergreatlyinviability, withtheresult that
the latter may occur much more frequently in the ancestry of the
existing wild population.

In the second place, on any biochemical view of the intracellular
activity of the genes, it is difficult not to admit the probability that
the heterozygote may be inherently more modifiable than are the
two homozygotes, especially in respect to the differences which
distinguish these last ; for in modifying the effect of the homozygote
we must imagine the modifying gene to take part in some reaction
which accentuates or inhibits the effect in question, while in the
heterozygote the original ingredients are already present for all that
normally takes place in the two corresponding homozygotes. The
future examination of the instances cited below in which modifica-
tion appears to be demonstrable should make much clearer than it
now is how much weight should be given to this consideration.

The fraction of the ancestry of future generations, ascribable to
heterozygotes, though greatly exceeding that dueto mutant homo-
We
zygotes, is still absolutely small. may obtain the proportion
ascribable to a single heterozygote, compared to a non-mutant, by

This quantity which, whenthe mutation rate (k) is 1 in 1,000,000,
risesto about 1 in 5,000ifvis 0-99, represents therate of progressin
themodificationoftheheterozygote,comparedtotherateofprogress
which would be effected by selection of the same intensity, acting
upon a population entirely composed of heterozygotes. In the case
of homozygotes the progress made by the Natural Selection of
modifying factors has been shown to be far from negligible, even
over short periods of observation, and under the serious restriction
that the supply of modificatory variance is limited by the small
number of the original stock. In considering the modification due
totheselectionofheterozygotesinnature, wemay
fairly
assumethat
these are atleastasliable togenetic modification as are homozygous
mutants, andthataselection acting onlyon 1 infive ortenthousand
ofthe population will have no appreciable influence inreducing the
variance available.

Special applications of the theory
An extremely interesting case showing the modification of the
heterozygote so far as to be indistinguishable from the non-mutant,
thatisoftheacquisitionofcompletedominancebythewildtypegene,
has been brought to my notice by Mr. J. B. Hutchinson from the
work of Dr. C. S. Harland on the genetics of the cotton plant. The
several species of new-world cottons can be freely intercrossed and
yield fertile offspring. One of these, the Sea Island cotton, has
repeatedlyproducedamutantformknown asCrinkledDwarf, which
inthatspeciesiscompletelyrecessive. Itappears to beidenticalwith
a similar mutant known asWrinkled Leaf, appearing insome nearly
relatedformsgrowninEgypt, butsofarasis knownnoneoftheother
American species throw this mutant. Inthe course of Dr. Harland 's
experiments the Crinkled Dwarf mutation of Sea Island was crossed
with two other new-world species, Upland and Peruvian. The out-
standing results of the cross were the same in both cases. The
heterozygote was found to be slightly affected by the mutant
character, thusindicating, evenatthis stage, some incompleteness of
dominance. The most remarkable effects, however, were produced
in the second generation, derived from the heterozygote by self-
fertilization. In this we should expect a quarter of the offspring to
be Crinkled Dwarf, a half to be heterozygote, and a quarter to be
non-mutant. Thehomozygousformsappearedasexpected, butwere
connected by a practically continuous series of intermediate types.

The heterozygotes in fact showed dominance of all grades. It is
evidentthatthe SeaIsland cotton differedfrom the othernew-world
species in a number of modifying factors affecting the development
and appearance of the heterozygote, the combined effect of which
in the Sea Island species is to render the heterozygote normal in
appearance. In this case the complete modification in the reaction
of the organism to the mutant gene must have been brought about
since the separation of this species from its new-world congeners;
the whole process of evolution from the first appearance of the
mutation, at least with appreciable frequency, must therefore have
been comparatively rapid. When the mutation rate has been deter-
mined this case should afford a useful guide to the extent of the
analogous events which we should expect to have taken place in
other species.

A group of facts of very particular interest in this connexion is
presented by domestic poultry. Crosses betweenthe different breeds
show that a number of the distinctive breed characteristics are due
tosimpleMendelianfactors. In anumberofcases, however, it isthe
fancy breed character, and not the character of the wild Gallus
bankiva, which is found to be dominant. There must be a dozen or
morefactorsofthiskind threeareknownwhichaffecttheconforma-

influencing the colour or pattern of the feathers, or the colour of the

other organisms, recessives and lethal 'dominants', but they are
peculiar in this surprising group of factors which are non-lethal and
dominant to the wild type. It is noteworthy that none of these
factors originated in a recorded mutant and that their effects, while
presumably they would be deleterious in the wild environment, are
not pathologicalin the sense of impairing the vitality of the birds as
domesticpoultry. Theyareall,infact, definitebreedcharacteristics.

Other birds bred in captivity seem to have thrown mutants only of
the ordinary recessive kind, such as cinnamon canaries, or yellow
budgerigars and for each of these reasons we should be led to seek

theonlymutationswhichcouldleadtoconstantbreed characteristics
wouldbe thosethatwere not completelyrecessive. Withthese some
ofthe chicks would always show the breedcharacteristic, andacon-
tinuedselectionorpreservationofthevaluedtypeswouldretaintheir

retained by selection, it is certain that selection would favour those
individuals in which the mutant characteristic reached the most
pronounced development. Man, in fact, whenever his broods con-
sisted half of heterozygotes and half of wild-type fowls, if he valued
the heterozygote characteristics, and therefore selected them rather
thantheothers, would
also,necessarily,
atthesametimeselectthose
heterozygotes in which the mutant gene was least recessive or most
dominant.

It will be noticed that on this view of the origin of some of the
breedcharacteristicsofthe domesticfowl, wehave an explanationof
two distinct peculiarities which these characters exhibit; namely
boththehighproportionofmutantcharacterswhicharenotrecessive
to the wild type; and of the high degree in which dominance is
developed, at least in certain breed crosses. It is important, too, in
this connexion, that other crosses are known in the case of several
of these factors, in which dominance appears to be incomplete.

A full and satisfactory examination of such cases would seem to be
possible only by introducing the mutant gene, and very little else,
into breeds in which this gene is unknown for dominance can only
;
properly be examined if the two homozygotes and the heterozygote
have, in other respects, a similar genetic composition. It may be
mentioned that my inference concerning the modification of domi-
nanceinmutantfactorsinthefowl,isopentothecrucialtestofintro-
ducing one or more of these dominants into a genuinely wild strain
of jungle fowl. If my inference is correct, the mutant would then be
foundtobe clearlyintermediate, andnoteithercompletelydominant
or completely recessive. Through the kindness of the Zoological
Society of London, and the generosity of Mr. Spedan Lewis, it has
been possible to start this experiment ; the result cannot, of course,
be known for several years.

The process of modification
The caseoffowlsconfirms,sofarasitgoes,the otherevidence avail-
able as to the speed with which dominance may be modified for in
;
this case, although the whole process has perhaps occupied no more
than a thousand generations, the effective selection is applied, not
to a population containing only one heterozygote in 10,000 or so,
but to broods half of which are heterozygotes and moreover in
;
which ex hypothesi it is the heterozygotes rather than the wild type
thatare chosen to continue the breed. Evolution under such human
selection should, therefore, take place many thousand times more
rapidly thanthe corresponding evolution ofrecessiveness innature.

As to the speed of the latter process, the principal unknown
element for a mutation of given viability (v) and mutation rate (k)
is the quantity of modificatory variance available to influence the
heterozygote. This willpresumablytend nearlyto zero as vtends to
unity, butitsrelationtovforvaluesdifferingconsiderably from unity
will be somewhat different according to the different views which we
mayformastothemannerinwhichthemodificationisbroughtabout.

In the case of homozygotes we must suppose that the modifying
factors, by intensifying the appropriate developmental reactions,
succeed, in effect, in remedying the situation which arises at that
stage at which defective development is initiated. This may also be
true of heterozygotes, and, if the greater part of the modificatory
variance available is of this sort, we should expect its magnitude,
ceteris paribus, to depend only upon v, and consequently that all
mutations would follow one another along the same path towards

wise dependent only on the stage which they have at any moment
reached. SuchaviewisillustratedinFig. 4.

On the other hand it does not seem, in the present state of know-
ledge, improbable that the greater part of the variance may be due
to a cause special to heterozygotes ; namely the varying extent to
which one or other of the homologous genes may be allowed to take
part in the nuclearreactions for which they are responsible. On this
viewtheamountofvariance available woulddepend, not onlyonthe
viability actually attained, but upon its original value ; being, for
heterozygotes ofthe same viability, greaterformutationshavingthe

of course expect to find most cases at the stages where progress is
slowest, and a comparatively large accumulation in any stationary
condition. The relatively rare 'dominant' mutants of Drosophila
may be regarded either as comparatively new mutations, or more
probably, as regards the greater number of them, as mutations in

greater number

ofobservedmutationsarefound, aswouldbeexpected,intheresting

stage of completerecessiveness, and in the case ofthe lethals, whose
condition should be absolutely stationary, the number accumulated
is enormous. With non-lethal mutants, after the heterozygote has
become,withinaveryminutedifferenceinviability,equivalenttothe

expectedtocommence
;
andthisforthesamelevelofviability,should,
ontheviewthatthehomozygoteisnotmuchlessmodifiablethanthe
heterozygote, be comparable in speed with the modification of the
latter. The second process would, apart from any difference of
modifiability, presumably be appreciably slower than the first, for
the homozygote may be expected to be initially much the more
heavily handicapped, though its viability may have been, incident-
ally, considerablyimprovedduringthe process of modification ofthe
heterozygote. Nevertheless, we must be prepared to admit that in-
numerable mutations may have occurred hi the past, of which even
the homozygote has become to all appearances normal, and which
consequently leave no trace for genetic research to reveal. There
appears to be noreason, however, whysuchfactors should notfunc-
tion in special cases in modifying the effects of rare mutants.

A caseofinterestinthis connexionispresentedbythetwofactors
forked and semiforked in Drosophila melanogaster. Forked is a sex-
linkedrecessivemutant,inwhichthebristlesofthehead,thorax, and
scutellum are shortened, twisted and heavier in appearance, than in
the wild fly. Since the factor is sex-linked, dominance can only
appear in the female, and ordinary females heterozygous for forked
havebristles indistinguishable from those of wildflies. Inthe course
of Dr. Lancefield's experiments with this factor in 1918, however,
thegene semiforkedwas discovered ; this gene hasno distinguishable
effectuponthehomozygousforkedfemales,orupontheforkedmales
;
it produces, but rarely, a slight shortening of the bristles in normal
flics, but heterozygous females are modified by it into clear inter-
mediates. Semiforkedthusactsasamodifierofdominanceinforked,
having biochemicaleffects similarto thosefactors bythe selection of
which,ontheviewhereputforward,itsdominancehasbeenacquired.

It is, however, scarcely probable that semiforked is actually one of
these factors, for it is itself a recessive, as judged by its interaction
with heterozygousforked. It may, onthe otherhand, wellbe anold
mutation which has reached a stage in modification at which even
when homozygous it exerts scarcely any effect.

Inferences from the theory of the evolution of dominance
One inference that may fairly be drawn from the foregoing con-
siderationsisthatthewidelyobservedfactthatmutationsareusually
recessive should not leadusto assume that this is true of mutations
of a beneficialorneutral character. Onthecontrary, wehavereason
tobelievethatitisconfinedto aclass of mutation which persistently
recurs, with a mutation rate not greatly less than one in a million,
and which has been eliminated with equal persistence by Natural
Selection for many thousands, or possibly millions of generations.

This class of mutation is, andwillperhapsalways be, of the greatest
valuetotheplant-breeder andthe geneticist,foritsupplies themwith
their most prized variants, but we have no right on this account to
suppose that it has any special importance in evolution. With
mutationsnotofthisclasswehavenoreasontoexpectdominancein
either direction. A priori it would be reasonable to suppose that at
the first appearance of a mutation, the reaction of the heterozygote
would be controlled equally by the chemical activity of the two
homologous genes, and that this would generally, though not neces-
sarily in every individual case, lead to a heterozygote somatically
intermediatebetweenthetwohomozygotes. Weshouldofcoursenot
expect all quantitative differences to be numerically equal, for these
depend upon our methods of measurement, and to take a simple
analogy, the removal of half the pigment from a black structure
mightwell be judged to produce less effect than the removal of the
remainder. To postulate equal functional importance of the two
homologous genes is therefore not to deny the possibility of all
appearance ofdominance, butthatageneralintermediacyofcharac-
ter, such as that to which attention has already been called in
heterozygotesbetween differentmutantsofthesame gene, shouldbe
the prevalent condition. The change brought about in a species by
the acquisition of a favourable mutation will thus generally take
place by two not very unequal steps taken successively in the same
direction. It is interesting that this situation bears some slight
resemblance to the successive mutations in the same direction,
imagined byWeismann.

The case of the evolution of dominance serves to illustrate two
features ofNaturalSelection which, inspite ofthe efforts of Darwin,
still constitute a difficulty to the understanding of the theory, when
the latter is illustrated by the active care of the human breeder in
selectinghis stock. These are the absenceofanyintentionbynature
to improve the race, and the fact that all modifications which tend
to increase representation in future generations, however indirectly
theymay seemto act, andwithwhatever difficulty their actionmay
be recognized, are ipsofacto, naturally selected. The acquirement of
dominance to harmful mutants cannot properly be said to improve
the species, for its consequence is that the harmful genes are con-
cealed and allowed to increase. There is some analogy here with
Darwin's theory of sexual selection in so far as this is applied to
characters of no use to the organism in relation to its environment
or to other organisms, andto qualities which do not assist the sexes
to discover and unite with one another, but only to qualities which
are preferred by the opposite sex. Even in such cases, however,
sexual selection does give areal advantage to one half ofthe species
inrelationto onesituation oftheirlife-history, whileinthe selection
of dominance thegenetic modification ofthe whole speciesresults in
the structural modification of an incomparably smaller fraction. If
we adopt Darwin's analogy of a human or super-human breeder
scrutinizing every individual for the possibility of some direct or
indirect advantage, the case of the evolution of dominance shows
wellhow meticulous we must imagine such scrutinyto be.

We have seen in the previous chapter, in general terms, that the
difficulty of effecting any improvement in an organism depends on
the extent or degree to which it is adapted to its natural situation.

The difficulties which Natural Selection has to overcome are in this
sense of its own creating, for the more powerfully it acts the more
minute and intricate will be the alterations upon which further
improvements depend. The fact that organisms do not change
rapidlymightintheory beinterpreted as due eithertothefeebleness
of selection or to the intensity of adaptation, including the com-
plexity of the relations between the organism and its surroundings.

We have no direct measure of either value, and the point at issue
can only be expressed in concrete terms in relation to some definite
change, real or imaginary, in some particular organism. For this
purpose the recessive mutations seemto supply what iswanted, and
the reader who accepts the conclusions of this chapter will perceive
that any maladaptation of the same order of magnitude as these,
and equally capable of modification, would be remedied by Natural
Selection some ten or hundred thousand times more rapidly than
dominance has actually been acquired. Totake a morerealcase, in-
stead of imaginingthat a whole species were suddenly changed so as
to be as ill-adapted to its conditions as our familiar mutants, if we
supposethattheorganicorinorganicenvironmentofthespecies were
to change suddenly, orthat a colonyofthespecies weretofinditself
in surroundings to which it was equally ill-adapted, we have equal
reason to suppose that the evolution of adaptive characters would
proceedatthesamerate. Itmightindeedbesaidthateachmutation
is such an experiment inlittle.

With regard to the precision with which adaptation is in fact
effectedwemustbecarefultorememberthatalloftheheterozygotes
ofthedifferentrecessivemutations,including, apparently,thousands
ofrecessivelethals, are genetically different. However indistinguish-
able the end products may be, these are produced by different
developmental processes, even if the ultimate differences are only
intracellular reactions. The fact that they are much alike can only
be interpreted as showing that likeness of this degree is requisite,
even for such approximately normal adaptation as is required of
aratherrareheterozygote. Ifanyappreciable diversity ofform were
possible within the range of such approximately equal adaptation
we should surely find it among this multitude of heterozygotes.

Since any differences which may exist between them are certainly
extremely minute we have here a clear indication of the closeness
with which any tolerably successful individual must approach the
specific type, and anupperlimit ofthe magnitude ofthe differences,
which have a reasonable chance of effecting improvement.

### Summary

Examinationoftheincidenceofdominance inmutationsobserved

to occur, and of other genes which must be regarded as mutants,
shows that in the majority of cases the wildgene is dominant to the
mutant genes, while in a minority of cases dominance is incomplete.

Different mutations of the same wild genes show mutually on the
other hand a regular absence of dominance. If the substitution of
mutant for primitive genes has played any part in evolution these
observationsrequirethatthewildallelomorphs mustbecomedominant
to their unsuccessful competitors.

Theincidence ofheterozygotes ofeachmutantamongthe ancestry
of the wild population is, if we may rely upon observed mutation
rates to be of the right order of magnitude, sufficient to account for
the evolution of dominance by the selection of modifying factors.

This process is extremely slow, since the proportion of the popula-
tion effectively exposed to selection is only about 1 in 10,000 or
100,000.

A case has been found in Cotton in which apparently complete
dominance has beenacquired bythe one of agroupofnearlyrelated
species, which shows the corresponding mutation; the anomalous
occurrence of dominance in domestic poultry may be interpreted as
due to the effects of human selection in flocks liable to be sired by
wild birds.

The theoryoftheevolution ofdominancethus accountsforacon-
siderable body of facts which have received so far no alternative
explanation. If it is accepted it appears to throw considerable light
upon the nature of mutations, and on the intensity of adaptation;
in particular the closeness of the convergence of very numerous
heterozygous genotypes indicates somewhat forcibly that adaptive
significance, sufficient to govern evolutionary change, is to be found
in differences of much less than specific value.

The measurement of gene frequency

IN ChapterII considerable emphasis was laid on thefactthat the

heritablevariancedisplayedbyanyinterbreedinggroupoforganisms
has no inherent tendency to dimmish by interbreeding, provided
that the variance is due to differences between particulate genes,
which segregate intact from allthegenetic combinations into which
they may enter. In such a system any changes in variability which
may be in progress must be ascribed to changes in frequency, in-
cluding origination and extinction, of the different kinds of genes.

In the present chapter we have to inquire into the causes which
(Jptermme the degree of variability manifested, or in other words,
into the level of variability at which the origination and extinction
of genes are equally frequent.

Itwill be sufficientto treatin detail the case of dimorphicfactors,
that is of loci to occupy which there are only two kinds of genes
available. It seems probable that the cases in which there are three
ormoredifferentkindsofgenespresentareinmost speciesinasmall
minority, and contribute inappreciably to the variance. However
thismaybe,theirexplicit treatmentwouldseemmerelytocomplicate
the statement ofthe argument, andto elaborate the necessary nota-
tion, without introducing any new principle. In considering di-
morphic factors we shallbe concernedwiththerelative frequency of
only two kinds of genes, which we have represented in previous
chapters by the ratio p : q, and with the causes by which their
frequencies are modified. It is therefore of some importance to
adopt an appropriate scale on which such changes of the frequency
ratio may be numerically measured. It would of course be possible
to adopt a percentage scale for such measurement, to distinguish
factors according to the percentages of the loci available occupied
by the two types of genes. We should thus distinguish factors in
which each type of gene occupied 50 per cent, of the loci available,
from factors in which the more numerous type of gene occupied
60 or 90 or 99 per cent., and discuss with what frequency factors
might be expected to lie in the regions bounded by these values ;
what proportions of the factors, that is to say, should be expected
to have their more numerous gene occupying between 50 and 60 per
cent, of the loci, what proportion between 60 and 70 per cent, and
so on. In cases where dominance has been developed we might ask
thesame questionsrespectingthefrequencynotofthemore
frequent,
butofthe dominantgene
;
andwouldthus distinguishcasesinwhich
from 20 to 30 per cent, of the genes were dominants, from cases in
whichtheproportionlay between70and80percent. Forallpurposes
of this kind, however, inview of the actual relationships to be dis-
cusseditis more usefultouse a scale onwhichtheratiobetweenthe
two frequenciesincreasesingeometricprogression. Starting fromthe
case in which the two frequencies are equal and each gene occupies
50percent, oftheavailableloci, weshouldthenregardthefrequency
ratios 2 : 1, 4 : 1, 8 : 1, 16 : 1 andso on, as equalsteps ofincreasing
frequency, although the corresponding percentages are 66-7, 80-0,
88-9, 94-1. Suchascaleissymmetrical. Ifwe stepoffintheopposite
direction we shall arrive at the frequency ratios 1 : 2, 1 : 4, 1 : 8,
1 : 16 with the complementary percentages. Mathematically the
scale we have chosen is equivalent to measuring the frequency ratio
by the variate
If the logarithms are taken to the base 2, our steps will be each of
unit length, while if we use, as is mathematically more convenient,
natural or Naperian logarithms, the steps, while still being of equal
length, will be about 0-7 of a unit. The two practical advantages of
theuseofthelogarithmicscaleforthefrequencyratiosofadimorphic
factorare, firstly, that it enablesanadequatedistinctiontobedrawn
betweentheveryhighfrequencyratiossuchasathousandmillionto
one, which can occur in the genes of numerous species, and more
moderate frequency ratios such as 1,000 to 1 which are almost
indistinguishable from them on a percentage scale; and secondly,
that the effects of selection in modifying the gene frequencies are,
on the logarithmic scale, exhibited with the utmost simplicity,
namely by changes of position with velocities that are uniform and
proportional only to the intensity of selection.

For factors which are not sex-linked, each individual will contain
two genes like or unlike each other. If every individual in a species
is thus enumerated, and counted as two, the maximum attainable
frequency ratio will be effectively the ratio which twice the number
of individuals in the species bears to unity. The range of possible
frequencyratiosonthelogarithmicscalethusdependsonthenumber
of individuals in the species, and it is easy to see that it is increased
by2log 10,or4-6,ifthepopulationinthespeciesisincreasedtenfold.

Forexample,aspeciesof 10,000,000,000 individuals will givearange
of values from about - 23-7 to + 23-7. Of this range about 5 units
at eitherend representcases inwhichthelessfrequentgeneexists in
only about 100 orless distinctindividuals, orto be moreexact, since
1 individual can contain 2 such genes, in about 100 homologous loci.

Inthese regions itis clear thattherarergene is, relatively speaking,
in somedangerofextinction, andtheabsolutelengthof theseregions

Between these two extreme regions lies a central region in which
both genes are comparatively numerous, at least in the sense that
neitherofthemwillexistinlessthan 100individuals. Itisthelength
of this central orsafe region which depends on the magnitude ofthe
population of the species. For 10,000,000,000 it is about 37 units in
length, for 100,000,000 it has only about 28 units. The logarithmic
scale thus affords a simple demonstration of the important bearing
which population size has on the conservation of variance.

In the hypothetical enumeration of the genes of the population
considered in the last paragraph, no account was taken of the age
or reproductive value of the individuals enumerated. If account is
taken of these there is no limit to the magnitude of the frequency
ratio attainable in either direction, but the distinction between the
relative insecurity of the rarer gene in the extreme regions, and its
relative security in the central region, is still valid. This statement
is based on the circumstance that a gene which exists in a dozen
individuals who, in the sense of Chapter II have low reproductive
value, isin atleast as much dangerofextinctionasone existingin a
singleindividualwhosereproductivevalueisequivalenttothatofthe
twelve others puttogether. Formatureformstheprobabilityofsur-
vivalmustbenearlyequivalent. If,however, thereproductivevalue
we are consideringis supplied entirelyby immature or larval forms,
normally liable to great mortality, the chance of extinction for a
given amount of reproductive value may be considerably enhanced.

It is therefore convenient to exclude the immature forms altogether
from discussion, andto considerthe results ofenumerationin which
individuals are only counted when they attain to the beginning of

then be conceived, not by the analogy of a census enumeration, in
which individuals of all ages are counted, downto an arbitrary legal
minimum at birth, but as the number of individuals of each genera-
tion who attain to the reproductive stage. In species having several
generationsintheyear, thenumbers ofwhich are also muchaffected
by the annual cycle, it is probable that the conclusions to be drawn
as to the effects of population size, will be most nearly applicable to
the normal annual minimum of numbers.

organisms these must of course be separate individuals, but where
self-fertilization is possible the same gene may be received by the
same individual offspring in each of its two parentalgametes, and if
such an individual survives to maturity our original gene will thus
be doubly represented. In general we shall be concerned with the
total number of representations, although it will be convenient to
speak as though these were always in different individuals. The

Inordertoconsiderthe chancesinfuturegenerations we shallfirst

This new function, which is the same function off(x) asf(x) is of x,
therefore takes the place off(x) when we wishto consider the lapse,
not of one but of two generations, and it will be evident that for
three generations we have only to use /{/(/(#))}, and so on for as
many generations as required.

Therearegoodgroundsforsupposingthat
if,
ashasbeensuggested,
enumeration is confined to the condition of early maturity the
functionf(x) will always have, to a good approximation, the same
mathematicalform. Ifwe consider,forexample,anyorganismcapable
of giving rise to a considerable number of progeny, such as a cross-
pollinated cereal plant, it appears that each sexually mature indi-
vidualis the mother of a considerablenumber, let us say 40, mature

and would become identical with them if the arbitrary number 80
were increased indefinitely. The departure from the Poisson series
is in fact ascribable to artificial assumptions which for simplicity
havebeenallowedtoenterintothecalculation. Wehave arbitrarily
assumed that each plant produces the same number of grains,
whereasinrealitythisnumberwillbevariable. Thenumberofpollen
grains also from each plant which enter into perfect seeds will vary,
and the effect of this variability will be to change the distribution
very slightlyinthe directionofthe limiting Poissondistribution. In

for the variability in the number of grains on different plants seems
tobe slightlygreaterthanwhatisrequiredinaperfectPoissonseries. The general character of the Poisson series which makes it appro-
priate to our problem is that it arises when a great number of indi-
viduals enjoy each a small independent chance of success; if the
number of individuals and the chance of each are such that on the
average c succeed, thenthe numbers actually succeeding in different
trials will be distributed according to the series

Table 2 shows in the first column the number of generations which
have elapsed from the starting-point, these numbers having been
chosensoastofollowthecourseofthechangesoveralarge numberof
generations, in amoderatelycompacttable. These changes are most
rapid at first, so that we have chosen successive steps of 1, 2, 4, 8
generations and tabulated the conditions reached after the total
expiration of 1, 3, 7, 15, 31, 63 and 127 generations. The second
column shows theprobability of extinction, at each stage, for genes
having no selective advantage or disadvantage. The numbers may
alsoberead,ignoringthedecimalpoint,asthenumberofcasesoutof
10,000 in which the descendants of the original gene will have
become extinct. The proportion of extinctions in the early genera-
tions is extremely high, nearly 3 in 8 are extinguished in the first
generation, andoftheremaining 5, 2havefailedbythethirdgenera-
tion. In 15 generations nearly 8 out of 9 will have failed. As we
proceed extinctions become very much rarer, only 2-87 per cent,
are lostbetween the 31st andthe 63rdgeneration, and only 1-49 per
cent, between the 63rd and the 127th when there are still 1-53 per
cent, surviving. The survivals may best be followed in the 6th
column, in whichitwillbeseenthat with the steps we have chosen,
the number of survivors tends increasingly closely to be halved at
each step; infactwhennislargethechance ofsurvivalforn genera-
tions is verynearly 2/n.

For comparison the corresponding figures have been tabulated in
adjacent columns for genes for which c = 1-01, and which con-
sequently enjoy an advantage of 1 per cent. the differences are
;
showninthe4thcolumn. Itwillbeseenthattheselectiveadvantage
amounts ultimately, in the limit when n is increased indefinitely, to
survival in just less than 2 per cent, of the cases originally started,
and of this advantage very little is gained in the early stages where
extinction is rapid. Of 10,000 mutations enjoying a 1 per cent,
selective advantage, and which have already reached the stage of
existenceinonesexuallymatureindividual, 3,642willfailtotransmit
the advantageous gene to any descendant, whereas withno selective
advantage whatever, only 3,679 will so fail. Even after 31 genera-
tions the number surviving out of 10,000 willbe only 687 against an
expectationof 589wherenoselectiveadvantageisenjoyed. Thefact
is, that a selective advantage of the order of 1 per cent., though
amplypowerfulenoughtobring aboutitsevolutionary consequences
withtheutmost regularity and precision whennumbersofindividuals
of the order if 1,000,000 are affected, is almost inoperative in com-
parison to random or chance survival, when only a few individuals
areinquestion. A mutation,eveniffavourable,willhaveonlyavery
smallchanceofestablishingitselfinthespeciesifitoccurs onceonly.

Ifitsselectiveadvantageisonly 1 percent,itmaywellhavetooccur
50 times, but scarcely in mature individuals as many as 250 times,
before itestablishes itselfinasufficientnumberofindividuals forits
future prospects to be secure.

The fact that a mutation conferring an advantage of 1 per cent.

in survival has itself a chance of about 1 in 50 of establishing itself
and sweeping over the entire species, shows that such mutations
cannot occur with any great total frequency before this event is
realized, or at least rendered certain, by the initial success of one of
their number. The odds are over 100 to 1 against the first 250
mutations of such a favourable type all perishing. Consequently
the success of such a mutation must become established at a time
whenthemutationrateofthemutationinquestionisextremelylow,
for in a species in which 1,000,000,000 come in each generation to
maturity, amutationrate of 1 inathousandmillionwillproduceone
mutantin everygeneration, andthusestablishthesuperiorityofthe
new typeinlessthan250generations, and quiteprobablyinlessthan
10, from the first occurrence of the mutation ; whereas, if the new
mutation started with the more familiar mutation rate of 1 in
1,000,000 the whole business would be settled, with a considerable
margin to spare, in the first generation. It is to be presumed that
mutation rates, like the other characteristics of organisms, change
only gradually in the course of evolution; whereas, however, the
mutation rate of an unfavourable mutation will be allowed to
increase up to 1 in 1,000,000 or even higher, without appreciably
affecting the character of the species, favourable mutations can
scarcely bepermitted to continue occurring for long, even at rates
1,000-fold less, and we cannot exclude the possibility that a pro-
portion of the favourable mutations that occur and are ultimately
adopted, may have mutation rates so low that they occur sporadic-
A
ally, perhaps once only in thousands of generations. quantitative
comparison of the mutation rates current in homologous mutations
in different allied species might well throw light on the difficult
question as to how rapidly mutation rates should be thought of as
increasing or decreasing.

Whenthere isno selectiveadvantage ordisadvantage, thefraction
of cases in which extinctionhas not taken place after n generations
is, as has been seen, approximately 2/n. It follows, since in the
absence ofselectiontheexpectationinanyfuturegenerationisequal
to the number now living, that the average number of individuals
in which these surviving genes will each be represented, is %n. This
number will, however, vary greatly in different cases and it is of
some interest to obtainthe actualform of its distribution.

This can be done by observing that, if the frequency with which
each number occurs is the coefficient of the corresponding power in
the expansion of

Knowing the moments we may now infer the actual form ofthe

if the probability of exceeding x,individuals is
An inference of some interest is that in the absence of favourable
selection, the number of individuals having a gene derived from a
single mutation cannot greatly exceed the number of generations
since its occurrence. Actually, the chance is less than 1 in 1,000
that x should exceed 3%n. If, therefore, a mutantform exists in as
many as 1,000 million individuals in each generation, we may be
confident either thatits numbers have been increased, atleastup to
a certain point, by selection, which is a relatively rapid process, or
by recurrent mutation unopposed by selection, which must usually
beamuchslowerprocess,orif wemustsupposethatithasoriginated
in a single act of mutation and owes its present numbers to chance
increases, that the process has been going on for at least 280 million
generations, which makes it much the slowest and, for such high
numbers, the least probable process of all.

A
similarinvestigationofthedistributionofthenumbers, attained
by the descendants of individual genes enjoying a small selective
advantage, shows that the ultimate form of the distribution is the
same in this case also. The probability of exceeding the number x
after n generations may now be written
showing of course that, as c exceeds unity, the numbers are certain
to exceed any specified value of # in a sufficiently great number of
generations.

The formula should represent the distribution correctly so long as
cn
2^~1)

is still a small fraction of the number of individuals in the species,

but it evidently represents only the distribution of the numbers
derived from mutations all of which occur in the same generation.

Thisisanartificialandunnecessarylimitation,since,aswehaveseen,
with advantageous mutations those which occur earliest will first
haveanopportunity ofestablishing themselves, and will, after com-
parativelyfew trials, preclude the necessity forfurther mutations of
tie same sort. We must suppose that when favourable mutations
ccurtheyhaveseldomoccurredbefore, andthattheirmutationrate
[ generally increasing. As to the nature of suchincreasewehaveno
irect knowledge, but if it is dependent upon a change inthegeno-
ppic constitution of the species we must suppose it to be gradual,
ndsincenegativemutationratesaremeaninglessthesimplestpossible
ssumption is that the relative rate of increase per generation may
e represented by a small number k, so that the mutation rate
icreases by the factor e k in each generation.

On this assumption the number of mutations which at any stage
re already represented in more than x individuals, will be pro-
ortional to
rhich turns out, when x is sufficiently large for (c - 1 ) x to be as
reat as 4 or 5, and large compared to k/logc 1, tobe very nearly
roportional to
In this formula we may recognize the element log c, which is the
mount by which the mutant gene avails to increase the Malthusian
arameter of Chapter II, or approximately the selective advantage,
01, of our numerical illustrations. It measures the relative rate of
icrease offrequency ofthe gene inquestion, just as kmeasuresthat
itsmutationrate. Ifitbesupposedthatthemutationratedepends
rholly upon the presence of certain groups of genotypes, we must
ippose k and log c to be quantities of the same kind, and of the
ime order of magnitude, but not necessarily approximately equal.

I we consider that, of the gene substitutions capable of influencing
ny particular mutation rate, some may be progressing in one
irection and some in the other, and that in generalthe increases in
mtation frequency due to the increasing frequency of some geno-
fpes, will be partly compensated by the disappearance of other
snotypes in which the mutation also occurs, it appears probable
lat k must very frequently be the smaller quantity. If we confine
btention to mutations possessing a selective advantage ofjust 1 per
mt., this amounts to saying that when such mutations just begin
) occur, the mutation rate is not increasing so rapidly as to double
3653 M
or treble itself within 100 generations, while not excluding the
possibilitythattheincreaseinthisperiodshouldbe 10percent, orso.

The practical consequence which follows if the ratio k/log c is small
is that, of the mutant genes which ultimately pervade the species
a large proportion are derived from that one individual mutation
which first has the good fortune to establish itself in appreciable
numbers, while only a negligible fraction can be contributed by the
aggregateofallsimilarmutationswhichachievealessorlatersuccess.

Whereas if k/log c were large the mutant genes would be derived,
though in unequal numbers, from a large number of separate muta-
tions, no one of which would contribute a large fraction of the total.

It should be noticed that in respect to the initial stages in which
survival is determined, c is the absolute rate of multiplication of the
mutant type, and only approximately to be equated to its selective
advantage over other genotypes. The difference becomes plain if
we consider not, as hitherto, a stationary population, but one in-
creasing or decreasing in numbers. In an increasing population
mutations possessing no selective advantage, or indeed mutations
at a selective disadvantage, provided this is less than the rate of
increaseofthespeciesasawhole,willhaveafinitechanceofavoiding
extinction; while with a declining population, even mutations
possessing a slight selective advantage, ifthis is less than the rate of
decrease ofthespecies, willbeinaworsepositionthanneutralmuta-
tionsin aspecies ofstationarysize. Inconsequence growingpopula-
tions receive greater accessions to their variability than stationary
populations, while declining populations receive less; and if the
intensityofselectiveactionsisthesameinbothcases, wemayexpect
growingpopulationstogrowmore
variable,
and
decliningpopulations
to become less so by a process which is distinct from the effect of
population size itself upon variability. In part at least the effect of
increase will anticipate the consequences of the effect of size, for it
will be shown that with larger populations statistical equilibrium
will be established with a larger variance, and the direct effect of
increasingpopulationwillbetoincreasethevariancewithoutwaiting
fortheslowerprocessoftheestablishmentofastatisticalequilibrium
to showits effects.

The scope ofthis causeislimitedbythe actualrates ofincrease or
decrease ofnaturalpopulations, andIsupposethatsuchchangesare
seldom so great as an increase of one-hundredfold in 10,000 genera-
tions, or about 1 in 2,000 in each generation over such a period.

How important may be the contribution of mutations conferring an
advantage or disadvantage of less than 1 in 2,000 is quite uncertain.

The distribution of gene ratio in factors contributing
to the variance
We are now in a position to considerthe relationships which must
existbetweenthegenetic
variability
maintainedina
species,
andthe
frequency of occurrence of mutations. The fundamental theorem
provedin Chapter IIwill have preparedus to findthat the variance
maintained in fitness to survive must be intimately connected with
thefrequencyofoccurrenceoffavourablemutations althoughapor-
;
tion of it is generated by the occurrence of persistent unfavourable
mutationsofthekindconsideredin ChapterIII, andis effective only
in continuallyfreeing the species fromthese defects. Such persistent
unfavourable mutations will also contribute to the variance main-
tained in all othermeasurable characters, and further contributions
must be supplied by those cases in which the generatio is in stable
equilibrium underselective influences, to be consideredmore fullyin
ChapterV,andbycasesinwhichtheadvantagesofacharacterinone
region or station occupied by the species are counteracted by dis-
advantages in alternative situations, a case the evolutionary con-
sequences ofwhichwillbe consideredin ChapterVI. Ourimmediate
purpose is to discuss the maintenance by mutations of that more
elusive and fluid portion of the variance which is maintained by
favourable mutations, and by those having a selective advantage or
disadvantage so smallthatitmaybeneglected. Part ofourproblem
willbe to determine how smallsuchselectiveadvantageordisadvan-
tage must be. The favourable mutations must, as was shown in
Chapter II, be generally exceedingly minute in their somatic effects,
and as we have seen in this chapter they must individually possess
mutationratessolowthatweareinfactconfrontednotwithacalcu-
lable stream of mutations of each type, but with individual and
sporadic occurrences. Mutations having nearly neutral effect might
on the contrary have time to attain considerable mutationrates, for
eveniftherateswere
high,
somemilliongenerationsormorewouldbe
required to establish the new type, and this would give time for the
mutationratetorisefromitsinitialinappreciablevalue. Apartfrom
this slight difference the two cases may be treated together.

To distinguish the parts played by the different elements of the
problem we need only considerthree cases. First the distribution of
generatiowhen,inthe absence ofselectionormutation, thevariance
isgraduallydecayingthroughtherandomextinctionofgenes. Next,
the distribution when the variance is maintained by new mutations
uninfluencedbyselection ; and finally thedistributionsappropriateto
slight selective advantage or disadvantage.

The most powerful method of treating the first two of these
problemsis that of obtaining afunctional equation for the series of
terminal frequencies. If the number of individuals breeding in each
generation is n, a large number of many millions or thousands of
millions, the possible values of the gene frequencyp are l/2n9 2/2n t
. . . . ; these possible values are very numerous, and in the greater
part of its range of distribution we may conveniently considerp as
a continuousvariate. Atthe extremes, however, amore exacttreat-
ment will be necessary, and here we shall make the simplifying
assumptionthattheformoftheterminaldistribution, whenstatistical
equilibriumisestablished,isnotaffectedbythesizeofthepopulation.

If now b l9 b 2, 6 3, ..... stand for the frequencies at the values
p l/2nt 2/2n 9 3/2%, ...... we may define a function
and the conditions of statistical equilibrium will yield a functional
equation, the solution of which will give the frequencies b l9 6 2, 6 3,
..... andthereforethedistributionofthegeneratio. Inthecaseof
,
extinctionwithoutmutation, wemay, inparticular, askwhatvalues
the coefficients 6 must have in order that just one gene shall be ex-
terminated in each generation. The sum of the values of these co-
efficients will then give the number of factors contributing to the
variance, and from this we can determine the relation between the
variance andits rate of decrease by random extinction.

Ifexterminationtakesplaceattherateofonegeneineachgenera-
tion, we maysuppose that half ofthese consist of cases in which the
number ofgenes present is reduced from 1, 2, 3, .... to 0, and half
to cases in whichitis increasedfrom 2n- 1, 2n- 2, 2n- 3, ..... to
2n. Genes represented in individuals will of course supply the co-
efficient of# in (f>, so that after one generation the function <j> repre-
senting the distribution at one terminal must be increased by |.

But in one generation we have already seen that </>(#) will be
replaced by
consequently the equation to be satisfied by is
<j>
To facilitate the solution of functional equations of this sort, it is
necessary to consider a function u v of an argument vsuch that
u = <S~\

v+1

If this equation is satisfied by any function /(v), it will evidently
also be satisfied by F(v) =f(v+ k), consequently we may assign
arbitrarily the value u = 0, from which u v, if v is any positive
integer,
maybeobtainedbydirectsubstitution. Inpracticevaluesof
u for non integral v are obtained by interpolating in the series of
integralvalues, at about v 20, and calculating lower values from
the interpolates by means of the relation

Random survival will exterminate genes at the rate of one ineverytwogenerations,
whileleavingthedistributionexhibitedunchanged.

This is an extremely slow rate of decay ; if the variance of species

and if no new mutations occurred, the variance would decay ex-
ponentially so as to be reduced after r generations in the ratio

No result could bring out more forcibly the contrast between the

danger of extinction.

deviations of this quantity from zero exert a considerable effect, the
chance of survival, for example, is increased more than fiftyfold as
anincreasesfrom - 1 to + 1. Thecontributiontothevarianceisless
sensitive, since this depends little on the terminal frequencies and
principally on the central frequencies ; broadly speaking neutral
mutations contribute half as much to maintaining the variance asis
contributed by those with a substantial selective advantage. If an

thefull value. Evidentlyin apopulationofathousandmillion, only
those genecontrasts,which possess an equipoise of advantage within

The distribution for favourable mutations from these minute ad-
vantages up to advantages a millionfold greater must be all very
similar, theprobabilityoffallinginequalrangesdzbeingnearlycon-
stant over the whole range of possible values. Disadvantageous
mutations are confined to smaller and smaller values of the gene
ratio as the disadvantage increases, until while the disadvantage is
stillveryminute,theonlyappreciablecontributionwillbethatmade
by mutations having appreciable or high mutation rates.

Although for the same number of neutral or beneficial mutations
per generation, abundant species will maintain a larger number of
factors contributing to the variance, than will rarer species, yet this
isdue principallytothegreaterrangeofthevaluesofzavailable. The
additionalfactors willthenhave somewhat extreme gene ratios, and
willtherefore contributelittletothemeasurablevariance. The great
contrast between abundant and rare species lies in the number of
individuals available in each generation as possible mutants. The
actual number of mutations in each generation must therefore be
proportionaltothepopulationofthespecies. Withmutationshaving
appreciable mutation rates, this makes no difference, for these will
reach an equilibrium with counterselection at the same proportional
incidence. The importance of the contrast lies with the extremely
rare mutations, in which the number of new mutations occurring
mustincreaseproportionatelytothenumberofindividualsavailable.

It is to this class, as has been shown, that the beneficial mutations
mustbeconfined, andtheadvantageofthemoreabundant speciesin
this respect is especially conspicuous.

The verysmallrangeofselectiveintensityinwhichafactormaybe

be in progress, altering the genetic constitution and environmental
conditions ofeach species, must also alterthe selective advantage of

undoubtedly be, the zone separating genes possessing a definite
selective advantage from those suffering a definite selective dis-
advantageis so narrow, ofthe order of thereciprocalofthe breeding
population,
thatitmustbecrossedsomewhat

Eachsuccess-
ful gene which spreads through the species, must in some measure
alter the selective advantage or disadvantage of many other genes.

Itwill thus affect therates atwhichthese othergenes are increasing
ordecreasing, andsotherateofchangeofits ownselectiveadvantage.

The general statistical consequence is that any gene which increases
in numbers, whetherthis increaseis due to aselective advantage, an
increased mutation rate, or to any other cause, such as a succession
of favourable seasons, will so react upon the genetic constitution of
the species, as to accelerateits increase ofselective advantage if this
is increasing, or to retard its decrease if it is decreasing. To put the
matter in another way, each gene is constantly tending to create
genetic situations favourable to its own survival, so that an increase
innumbersduetoanycausewillinitsturnreactfavourablyuponthe
selective advantage whichitenjoys.

It is perhaps worth while at this point to consider the immense
diversity of the genetic variability available in a species which
segregates even for only 100 different factors. The total number of
true-breeding genotypes into which these can be combined is 2100 ,
which would require 31 figuresin thedecimalnotation. The number
including heterozygotes would require 48 figures. A population of
a thousand million or a billion individuals can thus only exhibit the
most insignificant fraction of the possible combinations, even if no
two individuals are genetically alike. Although the combinations
which occur are in all only a minute fraction of those which might
with equal probability have occurred, and which may occur, for
example, in the next generation, there is beyond these a great
unexploredregion ofcombinationsnone of whichcan be expected to
occurunlessthesystem ofgeneratiosis continuouslymodifiedinthe
right direction. There are, moreover, millions of different directions
in which such modification may take place, so that without the
occurrence of further mutations all ordinary species must already
possess within themselves the potentialities of the most varied
evolutionary modifications. It has often been remarked, and truly,
that without mutation evolutionary progress, whatever direction it
may take, will ultimately come to a standstill for lack of further
possible improvements. It has not so often been realized how very
far most existing species must be from such a state of stagnation, or
how easily withno more than one hundred factors a species may be
modified to a condition considerablyoutsidetherange ofitsprevious
variation, and this in a large number of different characteristics.

INthesecondchapter oftheOrigin ofSpecies Darwin summarizes

astudyofthecausesofvariability, baseduponastatisticalinvestiga-
tion of the number of well-marked varieties recorded in different
species of plants. He was, perhaps unfortunately, dissuaded from
publishing his actual tabulations, but gained the concurrence of
Hookertothegeneralconclusionsthat 'Wide ranging, much diffused,
and common species vary most'. Darwin was concerned to show
that it was not merely that wide ranging forms give rise to local
varietiesinreactionto differentinorganic and organic environments,
but also that, 'In any limited country, the species which are most
common, that is, abound mostin individuals, and the species which
are most widely diffused within their own country (and this is a
differentconsiderationfromwiderange, andtoacertainextentfrom
commonness), oftenest give rise to varieties sufficiently well marked
to have been recorded in botanical works'.

A fewyearsagoitwasmy privilegetomakeastatisticalinvestiga-
tion of the extensive observations of Mr. E. B. Ford upon the vari-
abilityofthewingcolourinanumberofspeciesofnight-flyingmoths.

For thirty-five species the tints were sufficiently comparable to be
represented on a single colour scale, and for these the observations,
which included over 5,000 individuals, offered an exceptionally fine
opportunity of examining the association between abundance and
variability. It is essential in such an investigation to eliminate any
tendency for one group of species to appear more variable than
another owing to the peculiarities inherent in an arbitrary scale of
tints. Thedata,however,were sufficientlycopioustomake itpossible
to eliminate this source of error, and after making the necessary
allowances, it appearedthat, inboth sexes, thetenspeciesclassed as
'abundant' or 'very common' exceeded in variance the thirteen
species
whichwerelessthancommonbybetween 70 and 80percent,
the twelve 'common' species being in both cases of intermediate
variability.

Because many other factors besides numbers must influence the
variability, and particularly because the precision of any classifica-
tionofabundancemustbeexceedinglylow,itisessentialtobasesuch
comparisonsuponaslargeanumberofspeciesasispossible, andthis
seems to be an important cause of the present lack of satisfactory
databearinguponthevariabilityofspecies. Thedifferencesobserved
among the moths were, however, sufficiently substantial to be
statisticallysignificant,
evenin comparisonwiththelargedifferences
invariability foundwithineachclass. Itmaybe mentionedthatthe
same data showedin fact a larger variability in the species with the
widest geographical ranges, as contrasted with less widespread
species, although the differences inthis comparison cannot claim to
be statistically established. There is no reason, however, to believe
that an increase of numbers by increase of range is less effective in
increasing variability than would be the same increase of numbers
duetogreaterdensityofpopulation,forthenumericalratioofspecies
classed by entomologists as abundant andrare respectively must be
much greater than is ordinarily the ratio of the areas occupied by
different species.

The theoretical deduction that the actual number of a species is
an important factor in determining the amount of variance which it
displays, thus seems to be justified by such observations as are at
presentavailable. Its principal consequence for evolutionary theory
seems to be that already inferred by Darwin, that abundant species
will, ceterisparibus, make the most rapid evolutionary progress, and
will tend to supplant less abundant groups with which they come
We
intocompetition. mayinferthatintheordinary conditionofthe
earth's inhabitants a large number of less abundant species will be
decreasing in numbers, while a smaller number of more abundant
species will be increasing the number of species being maintained
by fission of the more abundant, and especially of the more wide-
spreadspecies, asubjectwhichwillbeconsideredinthenextchapter.

It may be noted, however, that whereas an increase in fitness when
invested in an increase in numbers in the manner described in
ChapterII, is nowseento bear asubstantialrate ofinterestinlaying

partscanseverallymaintain. Thereisthusinthecontinuouselimina-
tionofthesmaller specific groupsanaturalchecksetto the excessive
comminution of species, which would ensue upon specialization in
the direction of minutely differentiated aptitudes.

Among the factors which influence the relationship between
variation and selection may be mentioned the tendency of like to
mate with like, known as homogamy. Among the higher animals we
have no certain knowledge of this save in the case of man, but this
can scarcely detract from the value of the human evidence, since its
occurrence is contrary to popular opinion, and not sufficiently
explained by any circumstance of social organization. In collections
of human measurements the resemblance between married persons
is rather a conspicuous feature. Its principal biometric effects seem
tobe toincrease thegeneticvariance produced byagiven numberof
Mendelian factors with given gene ratios, and so to increase in a
fixedproportiontheintensityoftheselectiontowhicheachisexposed.

The effect of selection in human stature is increased in this way by
morethan20percent. Itisthereforepotentially animportantagent
in promoting evolutionary change. Its causes are quite uncertain.

It has been suggested that fertility depends in some measure upon
the constitutional similarity of the mates, but evidence for this is
lacking in the case of man and the higher animals, and I know of
no serious attempt to demonstrate the truthorfalsity of the sugges-
tion. It is at least equally possible that the standards of sexual
preference are slightly modified byindividual size, and on this view
the causes of homogamy can scarcely be distinguished from those
which,in sexual preference, to be consideredin Chapter VI, produce
direct selective effects.

Stable gene ratios
Wehavehithertoconsideredonlythosefactorswhichcontributeto
thegenetic variancein fitness tosurviveand progress. Thereremain
to be considered those factors in which one gene has a selective
advantage only until a certain gene-ratio is established, while for
higherratiositis at aselective disadvantage. In such cases thegene
ratio will be stable at the limiting value, for the selection in action
will tend to restore it to this value whenever it happens to be
disturbed fromitin eitherdirection. Atthis value the effect of the
genesubstitutionuponsurvivalwillbezero, andconsequentlynocon-
tribution will bemade tothegeneticvarianceinfitness,althoughthe
genetic variance in other measurable characters may be augmented
bysuchfactors. These cases have a specialimportanceowing tothe
principlethatfactorswillbefoundmost
frequently
whentheirrateof
change ingene ratio isleast. In consequenceofthis, iftheirstability
couldbe assumedtobe absolutelypermanent, suchcaseswouldhave
been accumulating in each species since its earliest beginnings; in
fact,however,theconditionsofstability mustthemselvesbetransient
during the course of evolutionary change, and we can only be sure
that cases of such gene stability must exist with a frequency quite
disproportionatetotheprobabilityofoccurrenceoftheconditionson
which the stability is based.

A single factor may be in stable equilibrium under selection if the
heterozygote has a selective advantage over both homozygotes. For
if we suppose the three phases ofthe factor to appearin anygenera-
tion in the ratio p2 : 2pq : q2 } and that their relative selective
advantages are respectively in the ratio a : 6 : c, then the three
phases in this generation will reproduce in the ratio ap2 : 2bpq : cq2 ,
where the absolute magnitudes of the quantities a, 6, c are a matter
ofindifference, onlytheirratiosbeingrequired. Ifequilibriuminthe
gene ratio is established this ratio will be the same in those which
reproduce as it was in the preceding generation, and therefore,
p ap2+ bpq
~~
q bpq + cq 2 '
whence it appears that
ap+bq = bp+ cq.

Subtracting each of these from b (p + q) we obtain
p(b-a) =g(6-c),

or

p b-c
~~ b-a
q
There is therefore always a real ratio of equilibrium if b -a and
6 - c areeitherboth positiveorbothnegative ; that is, if the hetero-
zygote is eitherbetter or worse adapted than both thehomozygotes.

A priori we should judge either condition to be exceptional; they
willnot, however, be foundin nature equallyinfrequently, for when
b isless thanaandcthe equilibrium is unstable andtherewillbeno
tendency for such cases to accumulate, whereas if b exceeds a and c
the equilibrium is stable and such cases will therefore persist until
the stability is upset.

Todemonstratetheconditionforstabilityitissufficienttoobserve
that the ratio
ap2+bpq
bpq+
cq

may be written
p(ap + cq)+pq(b-c)
q(ap + cq)+pq (b - a)
which lies between the ratios p : q and (b-c) : (b-a), if b exceeds
a and c, but not if 6 - c and b -a are negative.

In organisms capable both of self- and of cross-fertilization, the
situation in which the heterozygote has a selective advantage tends
togivetheoffspringbycross-fertilizationahigherreproductivevalue

suchasis assumedabove,thereproductivevalues of the three geno-
types willbesimplyin the ratio a : b : c. Hence for the genotype of
the firstkind the averagevalueof itsoffspring willbepa+ qb, if itis
cross-fertilized at random, against a if it is self-fertilized. For the
heterozygote we find \ (pa +b+qc) for cross-fertilization, against
J(a+ 26-fc) for self-fertilization. The average advantages in the
two homozygous phases are thus q (b-a) and p (b - c) respectively,
while in the heterozygote it is \ (p-q) (a-c). Remembering that
the frequencies with which these three phases occur are in the ratio
p2 : 2pq : q2 we find for the average loss of value in self-fertilization
=
%pq(2b-a~c).


Now according to our previous solution, equilibrium will be

established when

Usingtheserelations, we mayexpresstheaverage lossofvalue ofthe

offspring, causedbyself-fertilization, asahomogeneous expression in
a, 6, and c only, in the form
(b-a)(b-c)
2(62-oc) '
Thus, for example, if for any factor a, 6, and c were in the ratio
5 : 6 : 4 a stable genetic situation would be established in which the
products of self-fertilization would be worth, in respect of their
prospects of contributing to future generations, just -fa less than the
average products of cross-fertilization. Any other factors of the
same kind, which might happen to be present, would of course add
to the advantage of cross-fertilization. The formula, however, given
above, is that appropriate to organisms in which cross-fertilization
is the rule, for if self-fertilization is much practised the reproductive
valuesofthethreephaseswillbeinahigherratiothantheirselective

iftheselectiveadvantage of

issubstitu-
ted for 6, or vice versa. Without attempting to specify the exact
selective advantage enjoyed by each of the nine genotypes we may
specifythe type of selection under considerationby saying that A is
B
advantageous in the presence of but disadvantageous in the
presence of 6, and that B is advantageous in the presence of A but
disadvantageous in the presence of a. Equally of course in this
statement we might transpose the words advantageous and dis-
advantageous.

Equilibrium in such a system evidently implies that the increase
in the frequency of A which takes place in the presenceof B shallbe
exactly counterbalanced by its decrease in the presence of 6; and
thattheincrease in Bwhichtakesplace inthe presence of A shallbe
exactly counterbalanced by its decrease in the presence of a. But it
is important to notice that the equilibrium of the frequencies of the
gametic combinations AB, Ab, aB, ab requires a third condition of
equilibrium. By the conditions of our problem, two of these, which
wehave chosen to be ABand ab, are favoured byNatural Selection,
andincreaseintheirzygoticstages,whiletheoppositepair Abande^B
decrease. The adjustment of the ratio between the frequencies of
these two pairs of gametic types must take place by recombination
inthoseindividualswhichareheterozygotesforbothfactors. Ofthese
so-calleddoubleheterozygotes somearisebytheunionofthegametic
types AB and ab, and in these the effect of recombination is to
diminish the frequencies of these two types. This effect will be
partially counteracted by recombination in heterozygotes of the

itisobviousthatdoubleheterozygotesderivedfromgametesofthese
kinds mustbe the more numerous.

The inequality in the frequencies of the two kinds of double
heterozygotes in the case we are considering has an important con-
sequence; for whenever the two factors considered happen to be
locatedinthe same chromosomethefrequencyofrecombinationwill
depend upon crossing over, which is known to be much affected by
the genetic differences between different strains. Moreover in the
morenumerouskindof double heterozygoterecombinationresultsin
the substitution of the less favoured gametic combinations for the
more favoured combinations, and consequently in a reduction in
reproductive value, and this will not be completely balanced by the
increase in reproductive value due to recombination in the less
numerous kind of double heterozygote. Consequently the presence
of pairs of factors in the same chromosome, the selective advantage
of each of which reverses that of the other, will always tend to
diminish recombination, and therefore to increase the intensity of
linkage in the chromosomes ofthat species. This tendencyis always
in the same direction, and although thetype offactorialinteraction
from which it arises may be rare, yet owing to the stability of the
gene-ratios whichitinduces, we may anticipate that such cases will
be found present at any one time with a frequency quite dispro-
portionate to their rate of occurrence.

The discovery ofan agencywhichtends constantlytoincrease the
intensity of linkage, naturally stimulates inquiry as to the existence
of other agencies having an opposite effect, and under the combined
action of which, with that already discussed, linkage intensity could
havebecomeadjustedtoitsobservedvalue. Suchanagencyappears
to be at hand in the constant spread of advantageous mutations
through the populations in which they occur. For, unless advan-
tageousmutationsoccursoseldomthateachhashadtimetobecome
predominant before the next appears, they can only come to be
simultaneously in the same gamete by means of recombination. If
two advantageous mutations, which happen to be located in homo-
logous chromosomes, are spreadingsimultaneouslythrough the same
species, we may look forward to a future epoch in which every
gamete willcontain both advantageous mutants, andthese willhave
been derived in lineal succession, either from gametes of the same
kind or, ultimately, from individuals in which recombination has
taken place. Suchindividuals, we may infer,willhave been, for this
reason, somewhat betterrepresentedin future generations than the
remainder,inwhichrecombinationfrequencymusthave been,onthe
average, lower. It is apparent that for this process to have been an
effective check upon the constant tendency to increase the intensity
of linkage, thestreamoffavourable mutations must be an abundant
one. There seems, however, to beno evidence againstthe view that
even in every chromosome of most species numerous favourable
mutationsareatanyonetimealwaystobefound,eachasitincreases
in frequency, adding, perhaps only a trifle, to the perfection of its
internal or external adaptation. If the need of combining these
advantages is in reality the effective check to linkage intensity, it
may prove possible, as data become more abundant, to gauge in
this way, at least roughly, the relative rates of improvement in
different species.

Simple metrical characters
Characterswhichcanbe specifiedbya singlemeasurement,suchas
human stature,the length of an individual bone or tooth, etc., have
a special importance owing to the fact that they can be studied
relativelyeasily by direct biometricalmethods. As hasbeenpointed
out in Chapter II the idea of adaptation cannot be applied with its
fullforce to suchsimple characters, consideredinisolation buteach
;
mayneverthelessbesupposedtopossess anoptimumvalueinrelation
to the existing state of the organism and its environment, which we
may regard as nearly coincident with the mean value exhibited by
the species. That this must be so is evident from the extreme
rapidity with which such measurements aremodified when selection
is directed to this end. For example, it appears from the observed
average statures of the offspring of parents of different heights that
no extreme selection would be needed to increase or decrease the
stature of a human population by one inch in each generation, and
even with the long generations of Man, such a rate of change would
transcend the largest observed racial differences, within a short
historicalperiod.

If we consider any factor which affects such a measurement, and
of which the other effects, if any, have no appreciable influence on
survival, it is evident that the stability of its gene ratio requires
separateconsideration. Foritwouldseematfirstsight, ifdominance
wereabsentorincomplete, andinconsequencetheheterozygotewere
intermediate between the two homozygotes, that selectionfavouring
intermediate values would tend to favour the heterozygotes, and in
consequence induce very generally the condition of stability which
has been considered. If this were so we should be faced with two
somewhat alarming conclusions, (i) that by the accumulation in
conditions of stabilityofalarge numberoffactors with intermediate
heterozygotes, the metrical characters should indicate in their bio-
metrical properties a general absence of dominance, whereas, as has
been already mentioned (p.18) the body of human measurements
availablegive clearindicationsto the contrary, (ii) that the action of
selection infavouring theintermediate values would have the effect,
by preventing the extinction of all variant types of progressively
increasingthevarianceofthecharacterinquestion, and consequently
of making the intermediate values progressively rarer.

The recognitionthatthe specific mean adjusts itselfrapidly to the
optimum size, however, makes the problem an essentially different
one from that already considered, for the selective advantage of the
heterozygote is dependent upon the average deviation of this geno-
typefrom the optimum, andthiswillvary as the gene ratio changes.

If *,j, krepresentthedeviations ofthe average values ofthese geno-
types from the mean, the effect of selection will be equivalent to

and the gene ratio will onlybe inequilibrium ifthese two quantities
are equal. Further from the definition of the mean, we have
p2i + 2pqj + q 2k = 0.

If we use the latter equation to eliminate the deviations i, j, k,
replacing them by a single ratio, defined as
and which depends only on the degree in which dominance is ex-
hibited in the factor in question, we find that this ratio is connected
withtheratiop : q, when the condition ofequilibrium is established,

less frequent.

If any equilibrium were stable then the expression must increase

when q exceeds p, then j8 exceeds a. Consequently the differential
coefficient at any position of equilibrium is less than
and is always negative. The conditions of equilibrium are always
unstable. Whichever gene is at less than its equilibrium frequency
willtendto be further diminished by selection.

All mutations therefore affecting such a character, unless they
possess countervailing advantages in other respects, will be initially
disadvantageous, and we may conceive of each coming to an equi-
librium at which the mutation rate is just balanced by the counter-
selection to which it is exposed. This situation resembles that of
intrinsically disadvantageous mutations considered in Chapter III,
but differs from it in that for sufficiently high mutation rates the
mutant gene willnow pass the point of maximum resistance, and,
when it attains sufficient frequency, will be thereafter actually
assisted by selection. The mutation rates required to bring this
about depend on (i) the magnitude of the effect produced by the
factor, i. e. the metrical difference between the two homozygotes,
representedbya,
(ii)
the totalvariance ofthespeciesinthe measure-
ment in question, represented by a2 , (iii) the intensity of selection

Ifthereforetheeffectofthefactor
is so small that it will contribute at most one part in 100,000 to the
totalvariance, amutation rate ofthe order ofone in amillion might
well effect its gradualestablishment. Such would be the situation of
factors affecting human stature by about one-fortieth of an inch.

Factors having less effect than this might establish a mutant form
at lower mutation rates, in each case the more easily, the more lax
is the preferential survival of the medium sizes.

Mutant genes with greater effect or lower mutation rates will be
hungupatallvaluesuptop 0-25. Nowatthisvaluethemeanlies
midwaybetweenthe averagevaluesoftheheterozygote andthenon-
mutant homozygote; consequently at and below this value the
heterozygote might with advantage more nearly resemble the non-
mutant homozygote. There will, therefore, always be a tendency,
analogous to that discussed in Chapter III, for the non-mutant
gene to become dominant, by the modification of the heterozygote
towards greater resemblance with it. Dominance should then be
developedagainstmutationsinwhicheverdirectiontheyappear
;
thus
we may expect to find in such characters mutant genes of which
the tendency is either to increase or to decrease the measurement,
indiscriminately recessive. The fact that the offspring of crosses
betweenracesexhibitingdifferencesinmetricalcharactersareusually
intermediateisonewhichmighthavebeeninferredfromthisbilateral
tendency towards the development of dominance.

The development of dominance inevitably reacts upon the con-
ditions of equilibrium for complete dominance, for example, the
;
maximum counterselectionis metwith atp = 0-5, andthe mutation
rate necessary to establish the mutant gene is four times as great
as the value found for factors without dominance. The condition
necessary for dominance to increase is thatthe heterozygote shall be
on the opposite side of the mean to the non-mutant homozygote.

For any particular degree of dominance, that is for any particular
value ofa, dominance will increase so long as
With sufficient time, therefore, dominance will increase, and the
value of p diminish, until these two values are equal. The simul-
taneousvariation of the tworatiosp : q anda : ft willbe made more

clear by the aid of the diagram (Fig. 9) on which the curve
represents the series of possible conditions in which there is no
furthertendencyto modifythe degree ofdominance, and atdifferent
points along which factors may be maintained by appropriate muta-
tion rates. On the same diagram the line EAYC is drawn through
the points at which maximum counterselection is met with for
different values of a. A mutation commencing without dominance
will start from 0, and as its gene frequency increases, move along
the line OE, until it reaches some point on this line at which the
mutation rate is balanced by counterselection. At this stage, and
indeed during its progress towards this stage, selection will tend to
render the mutant gene recessive and the representative point will
pass along a line below EZ to come to rest on the limiting line ZB,
at all points of which, as appears from the diagram a exceeds 0-95.

At any stage an alteration in the mutation rate will move the
representative point upwards or downwards on the diagram accord-
ing as the mutation rate is increased or diminished, but it is clear
that a factor left without change in the area AEOB will gravitate
to the appropriate level on the line XB. Inthe same way any factor

mentofthe heterozygote from the mean ofthespecies is inthesame
direction as that of the non-mutant homozygote and selection will
favour any tendency to diminish this deviation. Such a path is

that this process cannot reduce the value of a below about 0-79

unless the critical line is crossed. Factors held in equilibrium

mutation rate is very nearly sufficient to overcome all opposition.

Finally a factor placed in the region will, if the conditions
remainunchanged, diminishitsdominanceuntilitmeetsthelineAC,
at which the effect of counterselection is a maximum and beyond
whichitgrowsweakerinsteadofstronger, whenthefrequency ofthe
mutant gene is increased. The course of such factors is, with some
vicissitudes, similar to that of factors which, combining the advan-
tages of a high mutation rate and a very small measurable effect,
never encounter sufficient opposition to check their progress. The
lowest mutationrate whichcouldmaintain the factoronsuchapath
is very nearly double that initially required for a factor without

dominance to pass at E, and is represented by the line sepa-
rating the factors which will pass ACfrom those which will be hung
up on the line XZB.

We are in the dark as to the frequencies with which different
mutations will attain the different stages indicated in the diagram.

The greater part of the area represented could, however, only come
to be occupied by mutations which fail by but little from passing
through unopposed. Mutations having a comparatively large effect
and possibly many others with less effect, combined with low muta-
tion rates, may be expected to be checked at low values ofp and to
gravitate to points near B on the line ZB, where it will be observed
that dominance, while still slightly incomplete, attains a very pro-
nounced development.

A second peculiarity of metrical factors, and one which may be of
more consequence, is that, of any two genes having similar effect,
that is both increasing or both diminishing the measurement, each
will be most advantageous or least disadvantageous, in the absence
ofthe other. The preceding analysis has shown that this interaction
does not lead to stability of the gene ratios, comparable to that
discussed on p. 102 ; nevertheless the interaction must have exactly
analogous effectsinfavouring genotypes which exhibit close linkage.

balanced and tend to a measurement of medium length, must be
continually favoured by selection at the expense of ill-balanced
combinations determiningthe productionofvery large orvery small
values. Thenumbersofthelatterwillthereforerequire ontheaverage
to be continually replenished by recombination, with the result that
crossing-over must, so far as these factors are concerned, tend to
lower the average reproductive value of the offspring.

It will now be clear in what way we should imagine the average
value of the measurements to be modified by selection whenever
such modification happens to be advantageous. If the optimum
value is increased all genes, the effect of which in contrast to their
existingallelomorphsisametricalincrease,willbeimmediately,orat
least rapidly, increased in frequency. In the case of those factors,
the effects of which upon survival can be completely expressed in
terms oftheireffectuponthe measurement in question, theeffectsof
such a change of frequency will be in some cases permanent and in
others temporary. Some genes previously opposed by selection will
be shifted to frequencies at which they are favoured, and these may
increase to such an extent during the period of selection that when
thisdies awaytheymaystillbefavoured. Theirsubsequentprogress
willthus tendto increase the value ofthe measurementeven afterit
has attained the new optimum. The same applies to mutant genes
the frequency of which is increased past the point of maximum
counterselection, into aregioninwhich selection, while stillopposing
mutation, is insufficient to check their increase. In other cases the
increase or decrease in frequency produced by temporary selection,
isitselfonlytemporary,andthese, whenthenowoptimumisattained,
will tend to revertto theirprevious frequencies, tending incidentally
by so doing, to make the specific mean revert somewhat from the
new optimum. The system resembles one in which a tensile force is
capable of producing both elastic and permanent strain, and in
which the permanent deformations always tend to relieve the elastic
forces which are set up.

Meristic characters
InhissearchforevidencesofdiscontinuousvariationBatesonpaid
considerable attention to variations in the number of similar parts
occurring, like vertebrae, in series. Apart from abnormalities in
development, variation in such characters is bound to be discon-
tinuous,thevariateexhibitedbyanyoneindividualbeingnecessarily
one of the series of whole numbers. There is no reason, however, to
suppose that the discontinuity so produced is in any way connected
with the discontinuity of the genetic particles in Mendelian inheri-
tance, On the contrary, it would be equally reasonable to suppose
a priori, thatthe actualnumberexhibited is butthe somatic expres-
sion, to the nearest whole number, of an underlying physiological
variate influenced, like a simple measurement, by both environ-
mental and genetic causes. That this is the true view must now be
regarded as establishedin several important cases.

The series of frequencies with which different vertebra numbers
occur bear a striking superficial resemblance to the series obtained
when a normally distributed variate is grouped in equal but some-
what large intervals of its value ; as if, for example, human stature
were recorded in a large number of individuals, to the nearest
multiple of three inches. The impression of similarity is increased if
instead of observations upon single individuals, we considerthe
simultaneous distribution of a number of pairs of parents and off-
spring, for in this case the average value of the meristic variate in
a group of offspring obtained from parents with the same value, is
found to increase quantitatively from group to group in a manner
exactly similar to that observed with simple measurements.

The actual proof that each individual possesses, in respect of a
character showing meristic variation, a definite genotypic or genetic
value,whichdiffersfromthecorrespondingvaluesofotherindividuals

ormore differentlines, developedinthesame environment. Alterna-
tively with organisms capable of giving a sufficient number of off-
springata singlemating, aseriesofmalesmaybebred,eachtoevery
one of a series of females. By comparing the averages of these
progenies Schmidt determined the differences between the under-
lying genetic values ofparents ofthe same sex, with sufficient pre-
cision to show that these differences could not possibly be integral.

If we regard such a variate as vertebra number as the somatic
expression of an underlying genotypic variate having continuous
variation, the striking constancy of such meristic characters in large
groups ofrelated organisms evidently requires a specialexplanation.

This constancy is made no less remarkable by its exceptions. Among
the great diversity offorms developed among the mammalia, almost
all have constantly seven neck vertebrae, yet two of the sloths have
six and nine neck vertebrae respectively. A similar situation in
fishes, in which several families with various vertebra numbers have
apparently developed at different times, from a group of families in
which 24 vertebrae appear to be invariable, has been felt by Tate
Regan to present such a difficultytothetheory ofNaturalSelection,
that he is willing to fall back upon the supposed effects of changed
conditions in producing mutations as an alternative explanation.

What prospect there is of such an agency, if its existence could be
demonstrated, aiding us in understanding this particular problem
seems at present uncertain. It is therefore the more important to
examine whether known causes are really as ineffective as has been
thought in bringing about the observed effects.

In groups in which all or nearly all the individuals have the same
vertebra number two views are possible; (i) that there is no genetic
variability, and (ii) that neither genetic variability, nor the varia-
bility of the developmental environment, is sufficient to produce
frequent departures from the central integer. The first view may be
set aside, not only because different species do certainly differ in the
number of theirvertebrae, but also because, inthe light of the argu-
ment of the last chapter, a mutant gene affecting the underlying
variate, unless it have other effects, will be exempt from selection,
at least so long as the vertebra number is actually constant. Con-
sequently, any mutations of this kind which have occurred in the
past must accumulate in such species.

Ifwe takethe secondview, heritable individualvariationexists in
respect ofthe tendencyto produce agiven numberof vertebrae, and
the species is therefore potentially plastic inthis respect. Supposing
the mean of this distribution to coincide with the modal integer, the
frequency of values other than this integer may be easilycalculated
from the standard deviation of the distribution for example, if the
;
standard deviation is J of a unit, about three exceptions are to be
expected among a thousand individuals, for of a unit only sixty-
threein a million, for T^ of a unit only one in two million, and so on.

Very extensive counts would therefore be required to exclude varia-
tionoftheseamounts,whichwouldneverthelessbesufficienttopermit
of an evolutionary change in vertebra number, if at any time this
became advantageous.

The evolutionary fact, which on this view requires a special ex-
planation, is that in large groups of organisms with widely diverse
adaptations,ithas soseldombeenfound advantageousto make such
a change, for in this the meristic variates offer a very striking con-
trast to the metrical variates. The integral numbers appear to be
possessed of a special kind of stability favouring a conservative
tendencyinevolution,whichisnottobefoundinthesimplemeasure-
ments. It is possible that the explanation of this tendency lies in
the simple fact that the intercalation or omission of a member of
a series of structures requires a corresponding modification of a
numberofassociatedorgans, suchasattachedmuscles,nerves,blood-
vessels, etc. ; andthatevenin cases where thereis a slight advantage
tobegainedbyacompletereorganizationonthebasisofanincreased
numberof vertebrae, itmay wellbe that such advantage is less than
the disadvantage suffered initially owing to the disorganization of
associated structures in any individuals which happen to have the
higher number. Even if the associated structures were morpho-
logicallycomplete, itisnotcertainthatallquantitative physiological
adjustmentswillbeperfectlyco-ordinated. Theargumentisaspecial
case of a more general one to the effect that in any highly adapted
organism the probability of advantage through any considerable
evolutionary step (saltation) rapidly becomes infinitesimal as the
step is increased in magnitude.

The liability to maladjustment should of course be least in species
showing considerable variability, such as the eel, in which we may
expect the developmental processes to be carried through nearly
perfectly whatever the actual number of vertebrae laid down. It
should be greatest where the meristic variate is most constant, and
where the capacity of the developmental mechanisms for dealing
with other numbers has not been subjected to selection in previous
generations.

Inthese,however,therarityoftheexceptionsprecludes
the possibility of demonstrating any associated signs of abnormal
development. An intermediate case, for which some data are avail-
able, is afforded by the herring. Ford and Bull have studied the
nearly 7,000 skeletons examined 95 were foundto contain abnormal
ormultiplestructures. Ifeachelementinthesestructuresiscounted

abnormalskeletonsis55-82,whichexceedsthemeanvaluefornormal
skeletons by only 0-03. Although the mean values are thus brought
intocloseagreementthevariabilityoftheabnormalskeletonsisvery
much greater than that of the normal. In other words the extreme
vertebranumbers53and58showthehighestpercentagesofabnormal
skeletons, the median vertebra numbers 55 and 56, which contain
nearly 90percent, ofthefish, showthelowestpercentages, whilethe
intermediate numbers 54 and 57 show intermediate percentages
abnormal. The actual percentages obtained from Ford and Bull's
data are as follows

It will be observed that the fish with the rarer vertebra numbers
show averypronouncedliability to develop abnormalstructures. If
suchatendencyisgeneralinthecaseofunwontedmeristicvariations,
as seems on general grounds to be extremely probable, any meristic
variation from the existing standard must in general encounter
appreciable counter selection, and could scarcely establish itself
unless the increased number conferred advantages which could be
obtained in no other way.

If we are right in referring the conservative tendency, which is
observed to hold in meristic matters, to the liability to disorganiza-
tion consequent upon a sudden change, it follows that this tendency

Biometrical effects of recent selection
Theimmediateeffectofselectionineitherdirectionistochangethe
average value ofthe metricalormeristic variate, as thecase maybe.

Such an effect can only be detectedif successive average values can
be determined, as is the case with some palaeontological material.

A further effect may be anticipated in a slight reduction of the
variance, by the elimination offactors previously contributing to it ;
this effect will be extremely small, and would in any case give no
indication as to whether the selection had favoured an increase or
decrease in size. Among the third degree functions of the measure-
ments there should, however, be traces of recent selection, which
would differ according to the direction in which the selection has
been applied. For a selection in favour ofincreased size would only
temporarily displace recessive genes having a dwarfing effect, and
these should remain in the species during such a process. On the
other hand a recessive gene, the effect of which is to increase the
metrical character, would have a chance during such a process of
becomingestablishedthroughoutthe species, bythe extinction ofits
allelomorph. Consequently after such selection has been long in
action the recessive genes should more frequently tend to diminish
than to increase the character studied. Equally when, as in the
developmentoftoybreeds ofdogs, selectionhasfavoureddiminished
size, we should expect to find an excess of recessives tending to
increase the average dimensions.

The biometrical detection and measurement of any prevalence of
dominance in one direction over that in the other would certainly
require very ample material, but apart from this the necessary
calculations appear to be straightforward. The simplest method,
that of measuring the asymmetry of the frequency distribution by
means of the third moment, will encounter some difficulties of
interpretation owing to the effects of environmental variations ; for
this reasonitmaybeinferiorto the study ofthe asymmetry of large
fraternities derived from differentpairs of parents. The most direct
investigation would be rendered possible by considering in con-
junction the measurements of father, mother, and offspring, and
expressingtheregressionofthe size ofthe offspringuponthesizes of
the two parents in a regression formula of the form
ax -fby - cxy
in which, x and y are the parental measurements, and a, 6, c the
coefficients to be determined from the data. Selection for increased
size will then tend to produce positive values of c, or in general to
increase its value algebraically, while selection in the opposite
direction will tend to decrease it, and to produce negative values.

### Summary

In the two preceding chapters anattempthasbeenmadetocheck

the adequacy ofthegenetictheoryofNaturalSelectionby adetailed
examination of the method by which on this view new genes arise,
prevail, orbecome extinct, and in particular new gene contrasts, or
Mendelian factors, become temporarily or permanently established
as contributors to that stock of organic variability from which the
rate of progress of species has been shown to depend.

The examination of the important problem of the survival of
individualgenesis much simplifiedbythefactthatsolongasfeware
in existence all other effects are unimportant compared with the
fortuitous element in the survival and reproduction of their bearers.

In many importantcases the survivalfora single generation maybe
represented by a function simply related to the Poisson series, and
in many other cases by the substitution for a generation of the
appropriatebiologicalcyclethesameformulaewillsupplyanexcellent
approximation.

Although initially subject to the full force of random survival,
beneficialmutations have a finite probability, simply related to the
benefit which they confer, of establishing themselves as permanent
intheheredityofthespecies. Theycan, therefore, haveoccurredbut
a small number of times before this event is rendered practically
certain. The mutation rates during their period of trial must
therefore be generally exceedingly minute, and it must frequently
happenthatnearlythewhole ofthe individualgenesthatultimately
pervade the species will have been derived by descent from a single
such mutant.

An examination of the statistical equilibrium established between
new mutations and the causes of the extinction of genes, shows that
advantageousmutations, at alllevels of advantage, resemble neutral
mutationsinthedistributionofgeneratiosestablished,thefrequency
being equal in all equal intervals of the variate z, in which it is con-
venient to measure variationsin generatio. The rangeofz is longer
in abundant than in rare species, and for this reason the number of
factorialdifferencesmaintainedinanabundant speciesbearsahigher
ratio to the rate of occurrence of new mutations than does the
numbermaintainedinrare species. The rangeofselectiveadvantage
which may be regarded as effectively neutral is, however, extremely
minute, beinginverselyproportionaltothe populationofthespecies.

Since it is scarcely credible that such a perfect equipoise of selective
advantage could be maintained during the course of evolutionary
change,
random survival,whilethedominantconsiderationinrespect
to the survival of individual genes, is of merely academic interest in
respect to the variance maintained in the species, which must be
mainlysuppliedbydefinitelyadvantageousmutations. In particular
the rate of decay of variance due to random extinction in the total
absence ofmutations is shown to be of the most trifling importance.

There are, on thetheory here developed, the strongest theoretical
grounds for concluding that the more numerous species must ceteris
paribus tend to be the more variable, though the rate at which
variability should increase in relation to increased numbers can, it
wouldseem, onlybeestablishedbydirect observation. Therelation-
ship between abundance and variability has been confirmed by a
finebodyofobservations onmoths,but deserves extensive investiga-
tion in other groups. An evolutionary consequence of some im-
portance is that in general a smaller number of large species must
be increasing in numbers atthe expense of a larger number of small
species,thecontinuousextinctionofthelattersetting anaturalcheck
to theexcessive subdivision ofspecies whichwouldensue upona too
fine and detailed specialization.

Of great importance for our subject is the occurrence, even when
due to exceptional circumstances, of gene ratios which are stable
under selective influences; since factors of this kind cannot be
eliminated unless and until, in the process of evolutionary change,
the stability is upset. The simplest type of these occurs when the
heterozygoteofa singlefactorisfavouredbyselectionattheexpense
of both homozygotes. It is shown that in this case an equilibrium
always exists and is always stable, whereas in the opposite case the
equilibrium is unstable, and the less numerous gene will be con-
tinuously eliminated until its extinction. The accumulation of
factors in which the heterozygote is favoured will give a constant
average advantage to cross- over self-fertilization, in the sense that
the progeny by cross-fertilization has a higher average reproductive
value, and is worth more to produce, than the progeny by self-
fertilization. The development of separate sexes in motile animals
andofthemanydevices toensure cross-pollinationinplants, though
notthe origin of sexualreproductionitself, seemstobe ascribable to
the smallconstantindividualadvantages due tothefavouring ofthe
heterozygote at least if we include in this phrase the constant
;
tendency of the heterozygote to resemble the more favourable
homozygous form, examined in Chapter III.

Othertypes ofstable equilibrium maybe establishedbythe inter-
action oftwo or more factors. The importance ofthis group of cases
lies in their constanttendency, whenever two suchfactors are in the
same linkage group, for the linkage between them to be increased.

The same consequence ensues, without the establishment of stable
equilibrium, when two factors of such a group both modify the
magnitude of any simple physical measurement, and have no other
effects of importance to survival. There is thus shown to be an
agency constantly favouring closer linkage between factors of the
same
group,
andsincelinkagevaluesareeminentlyliabletoselective
modification, and are not, in most species investigated, such as to
preclude frequent crossing over, it is an inevitable inference that
someothercause mustinduce anequallypowerfulselectioninfavour
of crossing over. While the mathematical difficulties of an exact
investigation are worthy of a far more extended treatment, it is
suggested that such an agency may be found in the advantage of
combining different advantageous mutations, which, unless they
occur consecutively, can only be done by recombination. It seems
probable that in order to exert a perceptible influence upon linkage
the stream of favourable mutations would need to be a consider-
able one, and that with further extensions of our knowledge in
this direction it may prove possible, by this means, to gauge its
magnitude.

Mutations whose effect is produced only upon simple metrical
characters will, unless their effects are very minute, be exposed to
counter-selection, andthemutant gene, whetheritseffectbe positive
ornegative, willtendto become recessive. Dominance in such cases
shouldbeincomplete,thoughinmostfactorsexposedlongtocounter-
selection the heterozygote should differ from the non-mutant
homozygote by less than 1/20 of the difference betweenthe homozy-
gotes. The evidence of dominance observed in metrical charactersis
thus in full accord with the analytic theory.

Meristic variation is, in those cases which have been investigated,
certainly duetoanunderlyingquantitativevariate. Specificmodifica-
tion in such characters is, however, constantlyopposedby selection,
arising by the interaction of co-ordinated structures. The striking
conservatism manifested by large groups of organisms in meristic
characters is thus rendered intelligible, while the possibility of their
modification at any time, during the reorganization of the relation-
ships and attachments of associated structures, is constantly main-
tained. Such anomalies as occur in the numerical variations in the
neck vertebrae of mammals may be cited as illustrating both sides
of the working of this principle.

The contrast between sexual and asexual reproduction
A GROUP of organisms in which sexual reproduction was entirely
unknown might none the less evolve under the action of natural
selection. Thisconditioncannot,Ibelieve, beascribedwithcertainty
to any known group. Yet, since it is impossible to draw any sharp
distinctionwithin awhole seriesofasexualprocesses, fromindividual
growth at the one extreme, through the regeneration of injured or
lost parts, to vegetative reproduction by budding ; it is tempting to
believe that asexual reproduction was the primitive condition of
living matter, and that the sexualreproduction of the predominant
types of organisms is a development of some special value to the
organisms which employ it. In such an asexual group, systematic
classification would not be impossible, for groups of related forms
wouldexistwhichhadarisenbydivergencefromacommonancestor.

Species, properlyspeaking, we could scarcely expect to find, foreach
individual genotype would have an equal right to be regarded as
specifically distinct, and no natural groups would exist bound to-
gether like species by a constant interchange of their germ-plasm.

The groups most nearly corresponding to species would be those
adapted to fill so similar a place in nature that any one individual
could replace another, or more explicitly that an evolutionary im-
provement in any one individual threatens the existence of the
descendants of all the others. Within such a group the increase in
numbers of the more favoured types would be balanced by the
continual extinction of lines less fitted to survive, so that, just as,
looking backward, we could trace the ancestry of the whole group
back to a single individual progenitor, so, looking forward at any
stage, we canforesee the time when the whole group then living will
be the descendants of one particular individual of the existing
population. If we consider the prospect of a beneficial mutation
occurring at any instant, ultimately prevailing throughout the
whole group, and so leading toevolutionary progress, it is clearthat
its prospect of doing so will dependupon its chance offalling, out of
thewholepopulation,uponthe one individualwhosedescendantsare
destined ultimately to survive. At first sight this chance appears to
be extremely small but we must take account of the fact that in so
;
far as the mutation is beneficial, its occurrence will increase the
prospect of the individual, in which it occurs, proving ultimately
victorious. Inthe limitingcaseinwhichthebenefitderivedfromthe
new mutation tends to zero the chance of success is evidently only
one in as many individuals as there are in the competing group. If
on the other hand the benefit is appreciable, the chance of success
will certainly be greaterthanthis by an amount which now depends
ontheamountofheritable diversityinthegroup, andontheprospect
of the occurrence of other beneficial mutations, before the replace-
ment of the original population by the improved type has been
completed. If the total rate of mutations is so small that the usual
conditionofthegroupisoneofgeneticuniformity, anyadvantageous
mutation may be expected to prevail, provided it survives the
chances of accidental death during the initial period in which it is
representedbyonlyoneorfewindividuals. Thesechances, whichare
effectively the same with asexual or with sexual reproduction, have
been considered in an earlier chapter (IV).

The evolutionary progress of an asexual group thus presents the
dilemma that itcanonlyutilize all those beneficial mutations which
occur, and survive the dangers of the initial period, if the rate of
occurrence of mutations is so low that the population of competing
organisms is normally in a state of genetic uniformity, and in such
astateevolutionaryprogresswillnecessarilybealmostatastandstill
;
whereasif on the contrarythe mutation rates, both of beneficial and
of deleterious mutations, are high enough to maintain any consider-
able genetic diversity, it will only be the best adapted genotypes
which can become the ancestors of future generations, and the bene-
ficial mutations which occur will have only the minutest chance of
not appearing in types of organisms so inferior to some of their
competitors, that their offspring will certainly be supplanted by
thoseofthelatter. Between thesetwo extremestherewilldoubtless
be anoptimum degree of mutability, dependenton the proportion of
beneficial to deleterious mutations, and therefore on the aptitude of
the group toits place in nature ; butit is not difficult to see thatthe
rate of progress, supposing that the optimum mutability were
established, would still be very inferior to that of asexualorganism
placed in the same circumstances.

The argument developed above as to the rate of evolutionary
progress of a group of asexual organisms may be applied to the
evolutionary progress in any one particular locus, in a species of
sexualorganisms,if we supposethatchangesofseveraldifferentkinds
may take place in an homologous set of genes. The comparative
rates of progress of sexual and asexual groups occupying the same
place in nature, and at the moment equally adapted to that place,
are therefore dependent upon the number of different loci in the
sexual species, the genes in which are freely interchangeable in the
course of descent. From what is known of the higher animals this
number must be at least several thousands but even a sexual
;
organism with only two genes would apparently possess a manifest
advantage over its asexual competitor, not necessarily from any
physiologicalbenefitderivedfromsexualunion,butfroman
approxi-
mate doubling of the rate with which it could respond to Natural
Selection. On this view, although asexual reproduction might be
largely or even exclusively adopted by particular species of sexual
groups, the only groups in which we should expect sexual reproduc-
tion never to have been developed, would be those, if such exist, of
so simple a character that their genetic constitution consisted of
a single gene.

The nature of species
From geneticstudiesinthehigherorganismsitmaybeinferred,that
whereas genetic diversitymayexist, perhapsinhundreds ofdifferent
loci, yet in the great majority of loci the normal condition is one of
genetic uniformity. Unless this were so the concept of the wild type
gene would be an indefinite one. Cases are indeed known, as in the
agouti locus in mice, in which more than one kind of wildgene have
been found, these being both dominant to their other non-lethal
allelomorphs; but numerous as are the loci in which such genetic
diversity
must
exist,
we havesomereasonto supposethattheyform
a very small minority of all the loci, and that the great majority
exhibit, within the species, substantially that complete uniformity,
whichhasbeenshowntobenecessary,iffulladvantageistobetaken
of the chances of favourable mutations. In many loci the whole of
the existing genes in the species must be the lineal descendants of
a favourable mutation.

single
The intimate manner in which the whole body of individuals of
a single species are bound together by sexual reproduction has been
lost sight of by some writers. Apart from the intervention of geo-
graphical barriers so recently that the races separated are not yet
regardedasspecificallydistinct,theancestryofeach singleindividual,
if carried back only for a hundred generations, must embrace
practicallyallofthe earlierperiod who have contributedappreciably
to the ancestry of the present population. If we carry the survey
backfor 200, 1,000, or 10,000 generations, which are relatively short
periodsinthehistoryofmost species,itisevidentthatthecommunity
of ancestry must be even more complete. The genetical identity in
the majorityof loci, whichunderliesthe genetic variabilitypresented
by most species, seems to supply the systematist with the true basis
of his concepts of specific identity or diversity. In his Contributions
totheStudyofVariation,
W.Batesonfrequentlyhintsatanargument,
which evidently influenced him profoundly, to the effect that the
discontinuity to be observed between different species must have
owed its origin to discontinuities occurring in the evolution of each.

His argument, sofarasit can betracedfrom awork, whichowed its
influence to the acuteness less of its reasoning than of its sarcasm,
would seemtobe correctforpurelyasexual organisms, forintheseit
is possible to regard each individual, and not merely each specific
type, as the last member of a series, the continuity or discontinuity
of which might be judged by the differences which occur between
parent and offspring; and so to arguethatthese provide anexplana-
tion of the diversity of distinct strains. In sexual organisms this
argument breaks down, for each individual is not the final member
of a single series, but of converging lines of descent which ramify
comparatively rapidly throughout the entire specific group. The
variations which exist within a species are like the differences in
colour between different threads which have crossed and recrossed
each other a thousand times in the weaving a single uniform fabric.

The effective identity of the remote ancestry of all existing
membersofa singlesexualspeciesmaybeseeninanotherway,which
inparticularcasesshouldbecapableofsome quantitativerefinement.

Of the heritable variance in any character in each generation a
portionis duetothehereditarydifferencesintheirparents, whilethe
remainder, including nearly all differences between whole brothers
and sisters,isduetogenetic
segregation.

Theseportionsarenotvery
unequal; the correlations observed in human statistics show that
segregation must account for a little more than two-fifths, and the
hereditary differences of the parents for nearly three-fifths of the
whole. These hereditary differences are in their turn, if we go back
a second generation, due partly to segregation and partly to heredi-
tarydifferences in the grandparents. As we look farther and farther
back,theproportionoftheexistingvarianceascribabletodifferences
of ancestry becomes rapidly smaller and smaller taking the fraction
;
due to segregation as only f ineach generation, the fraction due to
differences of ancestry 10 generations back is only about one part in
160 while at 30 generations it is less than one in four millions. It is
onlythegeographical andotherbarrierstosexualintercoursebetween
different races, factors admittedly similar to those which condition
the development of incipient species as geographical races, which
preventthe whole of mankind from havinghad, apartfrom the last
thousand years, a practically identical ancestry. The ancestry of

at 2,000 years the only differences that would seem to remain would
bethose between distinctethnographic races these, or at least some
;
of the elements of these, may indeed be extremely ancient but this
;
could only be the case ifforlong ages the diffusion of blood between
the separated groups was almost non-existent.

Fission of species
Theclosegenetictieswhichbindspeciestogetherintosinglebodies
bring into relief the problem of their fission a problem which in-
volves complexities akin to those that arise in the discussion of the
fission of the heavenly bodies, forthe attempt to trace the course of
events through intermediate states of instability, seems to require
in both cases a more detailed knowledge than does the study of
stable states. In many cases without doubt the establishment of
complete or almost complete geographical isolation has at once
settled the line of fission; the two separated moieties thereafter
evolving as separate species, in almost complete independence, in
somewhat different habitats, until such time as the morphological
differences between them entitle them to * specific rank*. It would,
however, be contrary to the weightiest opinions to postulate that
specific differentiationhadalwaysbeen broughtabout bygeographic
isolation almost complete in degree. In many cases it may safely be
assertedthatnogeographicisolationatallcanbepostulated,although
this view should not be taken as asserting that the habitat of any
species is so uniformly favourable, both to the maintenance of
population, and to migration, that no 'lines of weakness' exist,
which, if fission is in any case imminent, will determine the most
probable geographic lines ofdivision. It is, of course, characteristic
ofunstablestatesthatminimal causescan atsuchtimesproduce dis-
proportionate effects ; in discussing the possibility of the fission of
species without geographic isolation, it will therefore be sufficient if
we can give a clear idea of the nature of the causes which condition
genetic instability.

Any environmental heterogeneity which requires special adapta-
tions, which are either irreconcileablc or difficult to reconcile, will
exert upon the cohesive power of the species a certain stress. This
stresswillbeleastwhen closelyrelatedindividualsareexposedtothe
environmentaldifferences, andvanishesabsolutelyifeveryindividual
hasanequalchanceofencounteringeitheroftwocontrastedenviron-
mental situations, or each of a graded series of such situations. It is
greatest when associated with circumstances unfavourable to sexual
union, of which the most conspicuous is geographical distance,
though others, suchasearliness or lateness in seasonal reproduction,
may in many cases be important. I do not know any such circum-
stance, which, in the genetical situation produced, differs essentially
from geographical distance, in terms of which, therefore, it is con-
venient to develop the theory.

We may consider the case of a species subjected to different con-
ditions of survival and reproduction at opposite ends of its geo-
graphicalrange. Certain ofthegenes which exist as alternatives will
be favoured at one extreme, and willtend there to increase, while at
theotherextremetheywillbedisadvantageous andtendto diminish
in frequency, the intermediate region being divisible into a series of
zonesin whichthe advantage increases,from anegativevalue atone
extreme, through zero at a region in which the selective advantage
is exactly balanced, to a certain positive advantage at the other
A
extreme. condition of genetic equilibrium is therefore only
established if the increase in frequency in the favourable region and
the decrease in frequency in the unfavourable region, not only
balance each other quantitatively, but are each equal to the rate at
which genes diffuse by migration and sexual union, from the one
region to the other. This rate must itself be determined, apart from
migratory or sedentary habits of the species, by thelengthof each
zone across which diffusion occurs, by the density of population
along it, and finally by the gradient in the frequency ratio between
thegeneanditsallelomorphaswe passacrossit. Solongasasufficient
gradient can be maintained, accompanied by an active diffusion of
germinal material, so long the local varieties, although, possibly,
distinct differences between them may be detected, will have no
tendency to increase these differences in respect of the frequency of
thegenesinwhich they differ, andwill be connected byallgradesof
intermediate types of population.

The longer such an equilibrium is maintained the more numerous
will the genetic differences between the types inhabiting extreme
regions tend to become, for the situation allows of the extinction of
neither the gene favoured locally norits allelomorph favoured else-
where,andallnewmutationsappearingintheintermediatezonewhich
are advantageous at one extreme but disadvantageous at the other
willhaveachance of being addedtothe factors in which they differ.

In addition to those genes which are selected differentially by the
contrasted environments,we must moreover addthose, the selective
advantage or disadvantage of which is conditioned by the genotype
in which they occur, and which will therefore possess differential
survival value, owing not directly to the contrast in environments,
but indirectly to the genotypic contrast which these environments
induce. The process so far sketched contains no novel features, it
allows of the differentiation of local races under natural selection,
andshowsthatthisdifferentiationmust, iftheconditionsofdiffusion
are constant, be progressive. It involves no tendency to break the
stream of diffusion, or consequently to diminish in degree the unity
ofancestrywhichthespeciespossesses. Itisanalogoustothestretch-
ing ofamaterialbodyunder stress, nottoitsrupture.

There are, however, some groupsof heritable variationswhichwill
influencediffusion. Inthecase we are consideringinwhichthecause
of isolation is geographical distance, the instincts governing the
movements of migration, or the means adopted for dispersal or fixa-
tion, will influence the frequency with which the descendants of an
organism, originating in one region, find themselves surrounded by
the environment prevailing in another. The constant elimination
ineachextremeregionofthegeneswhichdiffusetoitfromtheother,
mustinvolveincidentallytheeliminationofthosetypesofindividuals
which are most apt so to diffuse. If it is admitted that an aquatic
organismadaptedtoalowlevelofsalinitywillacquire, underNatural
Selection, instincts of migration, or means of dispersal, which
minimize its chances of being carried out to sea, it will be seen that
selection ofthe same nature must actgradually and progressively to
minimize the diffusion of germ plasm between regions requiring
different specialized aptitudes. The effect of such a progressive
diminution in the tendency to diffusion will be progressively to
steepen the gradient of gene frequency at the places where it is
highest, until a line of distinction is produced, across which there is
a relatively sharp contrast in the genetic composition of the species.

Diffusionacrossthislineis nowmorethaneverdisadvantageous, and
its progressive diminution, while leaving possibly for long a zone of
individuals of intermediate type, will allow the two main bodies of
the species to evolve almost in complete independence.

In cases in which the cause of genetic isolation is not merely geo-
graphical distance, but a diversity among different members of the
species in their habitats or life history, in connexion with which
different genetic modifications are advantageous ; the isolation will
of course not be increased by the differential modification of the
instincts of migration, or the means of dispersal; but by whatever
type of hereditary modification will minimize the tendency for
germinal elements, appropriate to one form of life, to be diffused
among individuals living the other form, and among them con-
sequently eliminated.

The power of the means of dispersal alone, without the necessity
for selective discrimination in either region, is excellently illustrated
by the theory, due to Kay Lankester, which satisfactorily accounts
for the diminution or loss of functional eyes by the inhabitants of
dark caverns. Ray Lankester pointed oui>that the possession of the

with such very restricted habitats migrational selection of this sort
might attain to very high intensity and in consequence produce
correspondingly rapid evolutionary effects.

Sexual preference
Ameansofgeneticisolationwhichisofspecialimportanceinthatit
is applicable equally to geographical and to othercases isone, which
for want of a better term, we may consider under the heading of
reproductive or sexual preference.

The success of an organism inleaving anumerous posterity is not
measured only by the number of its surviving offspring, but also by
the quality or probable success of these offspring. It is therefore
amatterofimportance which particularindividualofthose available
is to be their other parent. With the higher animals means of dis-
crimination exist in the inspection of the possible mate, for in large
groups the sense organs are certainly sufficiently well developed to
discriminate individual differences. It is possible therefore that the
emotional reactions aroused by different individuals of the opposite
sex will, as in man, be not all alike, and at the least thatindividuals
of either sex will be less easily induced to pair with some partners
thanwith others. With plants an analogousmeans ofdiscrimination
seems to exist in the differential growth rate of different kinds of
pollen in penetrating the same style.

An excellent summary of recently established facts in this field
has been given by D. F. Jones (Selective Fertilization, University of
Chicago, 1928). Cases are known in maize in which discrimination is
exercised against pollen bearing certain deleterious mutant factors,
and in one case in Oenothera against ovules bearing a certain lethal
factor. Inthese reactionsboththegenotypeofthemotherplant and
that of the pollen are exposed to selection, and it is this that serves
toexplaintheremarkablefactestablishedbyJones'ownobservations
with maize, that pollen applied in mixtures is on the whole less
effective the greater the genetic diversity between the seed parents
and the pollen parent. Such a generalized tendency towards homo-
gamy, which is perhaps especially manifest in maize owing to the
enormous number of recessive defects, which by continued cross
pollination have accumulated in that plant, would, however, be far
lesseffective inpromotingthe fissionofspecies than wouldthe selec-
tionofdiscriminativetendenciesspeciallydirectedtowardsthatend,
such as must occur, as willbe explained more fullybelow, in agroup
constantly invaded by the diffusion of unfavourable genes.

Ingeneraltheconditionsuponwhichdiscrimination, when
possible,
can usefully be exercised seem to be (i) that the acceptance of one
mate precludes the effective acceptance of alternative mates, and
(ii) that the rejection of an offer will be followed by other offers,
either certainly, or with such high probability, that the risk of their
non-occurrence shall be smaller than the probable advantage to be
gainedbythechoice ofamate. The first conditionis satisfiedbythe
females of most species, and in a considerable number of cases by
themalesalso. Inothercases,whileitwouldbeaseriouserrorforthe
male to pursue an already fertilized female, it would seem that any
opportunity ofeffective mating could be takenwith advantage. The
second condition is most evidently satisfied when members of the
selectedsex are in a considerable majority atthe time of mating.

The grossest blunder in sexual preference, which we can conceive
of an animal making, would be to matewith a speciesdifferentfrom
its
ownandwithwhichthehybridsareeitherinfertileor,throughthe
mixture of instincts and other attributes appropriate to different
coursesoflife, atsoseriousadisadvantageastoleavenodescendants.

In the higher animals both sexes seem to be congenitally adapted to
avoid this blunder and from the comparative rarity of natural
hybridizationamongplants, saveincertaingenerawhere specific dis-
tinctnessmayhavebrokendown through maladaptationinthis very
respect, we mayinfer the normal prevalence ofmechanisms effective
in minimizing the probability of impregnation byforeign pollen. It
is therefore to be inferred that in the higher animals the nervous
system is congenitally so constructed, that the responses normal to
an association with a mate of its own species are, in fact, usually
inhibited by the differences which it observes in the appearance or
behaviourofamemberofanother
species.

impossible to say, but it is no conjecture that a discriminative
mechanism exists,variationsinwhichwillbecapableofgivingriseto
a similar discrimination within its own species, should such dis-
crimination become at any time advantageous.

A
typical situation in which such discrimination will possess
a definite advantage to members of both sexes must arise whenever
a species occupying a continuous range is in process of fission into
two daughterspecies, differentially adaptedtodifferent parts ofthat
range ; forineither ofthe extreme parts certainrelatively disadvan-

region most readilyattractedtoorexcitedbymatesofthetypethere
favoured, in contrast to possible mates of the opposite type, will, in
fact, be the better represented in future generations, and both the
discrimination and the preference will thereby be enhanced. It
appears certainly possible that an evolution ofsexual preference due
to this cause would establish an effective isolation between two
differentiated parts of a species, even when geographical and other
factors were least favourable to such separation.

Sexual selection
The theoryputforwardbyDarwin to accountfor the evolution of
secondary sexual characters involves two rather distinct principles.

Inonegroupofcases, commonamongmammals,themales,especially
when polygamous, do battle for the possession of the females. That
the selection of sires so established is competent to account for the
evolution, both of special weapons such as antlers, and of great
pugnacityinthebreedingseason,thereare, Ibelieve, fewwhodoubt,
especiallysincetheinvestigationoftheinfluenceofthesexhormones
has shown how genetic modifications of the whole species can be
made to manifest themselves in one sex only, and has thereby
removed the only difficulty which might have been felt with respect
to Darwin's theory.

For the second class of cases, for which the amazing development
of the plumage in male pheasants may be taken as typical, Darwin
put forward the bold hypothesis that these extraordinary develop-
ments are due to the cumulative action of sexual preference exerted
by the females at the time of mating. The two classes of cases were
grouped together by Darwin as having in common the important
element of competition, involving opportunities for mutual inter-
ference and obstruction, the competition being confined to members
ofa singlesex. Tosome othernaturaliststhedistinctionbetweenthe
two types has seemed more important than this common element,
especially the fact that the second type of explanation involves the
willor choice of the female. A. R. Wallace accepted without hesita-
tion the influence of mutual combats of the males in the evolution
ofsex-limitedweapons, butrejectedaltogethertheelementoffemale
choice in the evolution of sex-limited ornaments.

It has been pointed out in Chapter II that a detailed knowledge
of the action of Natural Selectionwould require an accurate evalua-
tion ofthe rates of death and reproduction ofthespecies at all ages,
and of the effects of all the possiblegenetic substitutions upon these
rates. The distinction between one kind of selection and another
would seem to require information in one respect infinitely more
detailed, for we should require to know not the gross rates of death
and reproduction only, but the nature and frequency of all the
bionomic situations in which these events occur. The classification
of causes ofdeathrequired bylawissufficiently complex, and would
require very extensive medical knowledge if full justice were to be
done to it in every case. Even qualified medical men, however, are
not required to specify the sociological causes of birth. In pointing
out the immense complexity of the problem of discriminating to
which possible means of selection a known evolutionarychange is to
be ascribed, or of allotting to several different means their share in
producing the effect, I should not like to be taken to be throwing
doubt on the value of such distinctions as can be made among the
different bionomic situations in which selection can be effected. The
morphological phenomena may be so striking, the life-history and
instincts may have been so fully studied in the native habitat, that
amind fullystoredwith all the analogieswithinitsfieldofstudymay
be led to perceive that one explanation only, out of those which are
offered, carries with it a convincing weight of evidence. Every case
must,Iconceive,besostudiedandjudgeduponbypersonsacquainted
with the details of the case, and even so in the vast majority of
cases the evidencewill be too scantyto be decisive. It wouldaccord
illwiththescopeofthisbook (andwiththepretensionsofitsauthor)
to attempt such a decision in any particular case. There does seem
room, however,foramoreaccurateexaminationofthevalidityofthe
varioustypesofargumentwhichhavebeenused, andwhichmustbe
used if anyinterpretation at allis to be putupon the evidence, than
seems hitherto to have been attempted.

It is certain that some will feel that such an abstract form of
treatment does injury to the interest of the subject. On the other
hand I am confident that many engaged in the actual work of
observation and classification would welcome any serious attempt
to establish impartial principles of interpretation. The need is
greatest in a subject, in which generalizations embodying large
numbers of observational facts are of such high value, that in con-
troversy mere citations of fresh facts seem sometimes to be invested
with a logical force, which they do not really possess; it is possible
thusforeventhe fairest minded of men, when thoroughly convinced
of the correctness of his own interpretation, in which conviction he
may be fullyjustified, to use in its support arguments which, hadhe
been in real doubt, he could scarcely have employed. To take but
a single instance of a most innocent lapse of logic in discussions of
sexual selection; it was pointed out by Wallace that very many
species which are conspicuously or brilliantly coloured, and in which
the females are coloured either exactly like the males, or, when
differently coloured are equally conspicuous, eithernestin concealed

cealment Wallace perceived an explanation of the lack of protective
coloration in the female. To the objection, which seems to have
originated with the Duke ofArgyll, that a large domed nest is more
conspicuous to an enemy than a smaller open nest, Wallace replied
that as a matter of fact they do protect from attack, for hawks or
crowsdo not pluck such nests to pieces. Darwin, on the otherhand,
believed that there was much truth in the Duke of Argyll's remark,
especiallyinrespectto alltree-haunting carnivorous animals. It will
be noticed that neither controversialist seems to perceive that the
issueisnotconcernedwiththeadvantagesordisadvantagesofcovered
nests, orthat, howeverdisadvantageousthesenestsmay besupposed
to be, they nevertheless do fulfil the conditions required by Wallace
of precluding the selection during brooding of protective colours in
the female, by the action of predators to which brooding females
might otherwise have been visible.

A much more serious error, which has not been without echoes in
biologicalopinion, was madeby Wallacein arguingthatthe effectof
selection in the adult is diminished by a large mortality at earlier
stages (Darwinism, p. 296).

In butterflies the weeding out bynatural selection takes place to an
enormous extent in the egg, larva, and pupa states ; and perhaps not
more than one in a hundred of the eggs laid produces a perfect insect
which lives to breed. Here, then, the impotence of female selection, if
it exists, must be complete; for, unless the most brilliantly coloured
males arc those which produce the best protected eggs, larvae, and
pupae,andunlesstheparticulareggs, larvae, andpupae, which areable
tosurvive,arethosewhichproducethemost brilliantlycolouredbutter-
flies, any choice the female might make must be completely swamped.

If, on the other hand, there is this correlation between colour develop-
ment and perfect adaptation at all stages, then this development will
necessarily proceed by the agency of natural selection and the general
laws which determine the production of colour and of ornamental
appendages.

It should be observed that if one mature form has an advantage
over another, represented by a greater expectation of offspring, this
advantage is in no way diminished by the incidence of mortalityin
theimmature stagesofdevelopment, providedthere isno association
between mature and immature characters. The immature mortality
mightbe athousandfoldgreater, as indeeditis if wetake accountof
the mortality of gametes, without exerting the slightest influence
upon the efficacy of the selection of the mature form. Moreover,
Wallace himself attached great importance to other selective effects
exerted upon mature butterflies as is shown by his treatment of
protective resemblance on page 207 of the same work. It cannot
therefore have been the cogency of the argument he uses which
determined Wallace's opinion, but rather the firmness of his con-
victionthattheaestheticfacultieswereapartofthef spiritualnature'
conferreduponmankindaloneby a supernatural act, which supplies
an explanation of the looseness of his argument.

The two fundamental conditions which must be fulfilled if an
evolutionary change is to be ascribed to sexual selection are (i) the
existence of sexual preference at least in one sex, and (ii) bionomic
conditions in which such preference shall confer a reproductive
advantage. In cases where the two conditions can be satisfied, the
existence of special structures, whichon morphologicalgrounds may
be judgedtobeefficaciousasornaments, buttoservenootheruseful
purpose, combined with ecological evidence that the structures are
at their fullest development in the mating season, and are then
paraded conspicuously, provides evidence of the same kind as, in
other cases, is deemed conclusive as to the evolutionary significance
of bodily structures.

With respect to sexual preference, the direct evidence of its
existence in animals other than man is, and perhaps alwayswill be,
meagre. Theextremeoddityofthepreferencesreportedofindividual
birdsincaptivitysuggeststhattheirmentalityissometimesderanged,
at least in respect of sexual preference, by the artificial conditions,
and show no more that an effective nervous mechanism does in fact
exist, whichresponds differentlyto different suitors. The only point
ofvalue, whichit would seem mightbe determinedby such observa-
tions, is the extent to which different hen birds concur in their
preferencesamong the cocks. Since,Isuppose, only one choicecould
beconfidentlyobservedineachseason,suchatestcouldonlybeapplied
with sufficientnumberstopolygamous birds amongthese, however,
;
it shouldbe possible to demonstrate it with certainty, if an order of
preference exists.

The strongest argument adduced by Darwin in respect to birds in
the wildstate must certainly begiven now adifferentinterpretation.

He gives numerous cases in which whenone of apair ofbirds is shot
its place is found almost immediately to be taken by another of the
same sex, whether male or female. He concludes that, surprising as
it may seem, manybirds of both sexes remain unpaired, and also
and here only we part companywithhim this,becausethey cannot
findamatetopleasethem. Ifthiswerethetrueexplanationitwould

inaconsiderableproportionofbirds, andsuchintensityofpreference
could scarcelybemaintainedina speciesunlesstheadvantageto the
prospects of the progeny due to the possibility of gaining a very
superior matewere larger than the certain loss of an entire breeding
season. Aswillbeseen,itisdifficulttoassigninmostcasesarational
basis for so great an advantage. Ontheotherhandtheresearchesof
H.E. Howard upon Territory inBird Life provide averysimple and
adequate explanation of the fact observed. On this view the birds
which remain unmated do so because they are not in possession of
a breeding territory where they can nest unmolested, but are ready
to mate at once with a widow or widower left in possession of this
covetedproperty. Idonotknow,however,howmuchevidencethere
is for asserting that it is always the widowed bird and a new mate,
rather than a new pair, which is found in possession of the vacant
territory. The adoption of existing young suggests that sometimes
at least it is the former.

Ifinsteadofregardingtheexistence ofsexualpreference asabasic
fact to be established only by direct observation, we consider that
the tastes of organisms, like their organs and faculties, must be
regarded as the products of evolutionary change, governed by the
relative advantage which such tastes may confer, it appears, as has
been shown in a previous section, that occasions may be not in-
frequent when a sexual preference of a particular kind may confer
aselectiveadvantage,andthereforebecomeestablishedinthespecies.

Whenever appreciable differencesexistin a species, which are infact
correlatedwithselectiveadvantage,therewillbe atendencytoselect
also those individuals of the opposite sex which most clearly dis-
criminate the difference to be observed, and which most decidedly
preferthe more advantageoustype. Sexualpreference originatingin
this way may or may not confer any direct advantage upon the
individualsselected, and so hastenthe effectofthe Natural Selection
in progress. It may therefore be far more widespread than the
occurrence of striking secondary sexual characters.

Certain remarkable consequences do, however, follow if some
sexual preferences of this kind, determined, for example, by a
plumagecharacter,aredevelopedinaspeciesinwhichthepreferences
of one sex, in particular the female, have a great influence on the
number of offspring left by individual males. In such cases the
modification of the plumage character in the cock proceeds under
two selective influences (i) an initial advantage not due to sexual
preference, which advantage may be quite inconsiderable in magni-
tude, and (ii) an additional advantage conferred by female prefer-
ence, which will be proportional to the intensity of this preference.

The intensityofpreferencewillitselfbeincreasedbyselectionsolong
asthesonsofhensexercisingthepreference mostdecidedly haveany
advantageoverthesonsofotherhens, whetherthisbeduetothefirst
or to the second cause. The importance of this situation lies in the
fact that the further development of the plumage character will still
proceed, byreason ofthe advantage gained in sexual selection, even
after it has passed the point in development at which its advantage
in Natural Selection has ceased. The selective agencies other than
sexual preference may be opposed to further development, and yet
the further development will proceed, so long as the disadvantage
is more thancounterbalanced by the advantage in sexual selection.

Moreover, as long as there is a net advantage in favour of further
plumagedevelopment,there will alsobeanetadvantage infavourof
giving to it a more decidedpreference.

Thetwocharacteristicsaffectedbysucha process,namelyplumage
development in the male, and sexual preference for such develop-
ments inthefemale, must thus advance together, and so long as the
process is unchecked by severe counterselection, will advance with
ever-increasingspeed. Inthe total absence of such checks, it is easy
to see that the speed of development will be proportional to the
development already attained, which will therefore increase with
time exponentially,oringeometricprogression. Thereisthusinany
bionomicsituation,inwhich sexual selection is capable of conferring
a great reproductive advantage, the potentiality of a runaway
process, which, however small the beginnings from which it arose,
must, unless checked, produce great effects, and in the later stages
with great rapidity.

Such a process must soon run against some check. Two such are
obvious. If carried far enough, it is evident that sufficiently severe
counterselection in favour of less ornamented males will be encoun-
tered to balance the advantage of sexual preference ; at this point
both plumage elaboration and the increase in female preference will
be brought to a standstill, and a condition of relative stability will
be attained. It willbe more effective still if the disadvantage to the
malesoftheirsexualornamentssodiminishestheirnumbers

the process, by diminishing the reproductive advantage to be con-
ferredbyfemalepreference. Itisimportanttonoticethatthecondi-
tion ofrelative stability brought aboutbythese or other means, will
be offarlongerdurationthantheprocessinwhichtheornamentsare
evolved. In most existing species the runaway process must have
been already checked, and we should expect that the more extra-
ordinary developments of sexual plumage were not due like most
characters to a long and even course of evolutionary progress, but
to sudden spurts of change. The theory does not enable us to
predict the outcome of such an episode, but points to a great
3653 m
advantage being conferred by sexual preference as its underlying
condition.

Exactlyinwhat way the males which most effectually attractthe
attention and interest of the females gain thereby a reproductive
advantage is a much more difficult question, since polygamy is not
nearly so widespread as sex-limited ornaments, and the theory of
sexual selection therefore requires thatsome reproductive advantage
should be conferred also in certain monogamous birds. Darwin's
theory onthispointisexceedinglysubtle. He supposesineffectthat
there is a positive correlation in the females between the earliness
with which they are ready to breed, and the numbers of offspring
they rear, variations in both these variates being associated, as
Darwin suggests, with a higher nutritional condition. Whetherthis
is so in fact it is difficult to say, but it should be noted that the
dates of the breedingphenomenaofa speciescouldonlybestabilized
if birds congenitally prone to breed early did not for this reason
producemore
offspring.

ThecorrelationrequiredbyDarwin'stheory
must be due solely to non-hereditary causes, such as chance varia-
tions of nutrition might supply. Whether or not there is such a
correlation, it would seem no easy matter to demonstrate.

There does seem, however, to be one advantage enjoyed by the
males mated earliest inany one district, and which therefore might
be conferred by sexual preference; namely, that due to mortality
during the breeding season. The death rates of animals are often
surprisingly high, and a death rate of only one per cent, per week
would giveaconsiderableadvantagetotheearliermatedmales,even
ifthe chances of survivalof his offspring were unfavourably affected
by his death.

A second circumstance in which sexual preference must afford
some reproductive advantage is in the remating of birds widowed
during the breeding season it appears certain that an abundance of
;
unmatedbirdsareusuallyathandto takeadvantageofsuchasitua-
tion, andthechoice amongthesegivestothose preferred areproduc-
tiveadvantage, equallyinthecaseofbothsexes. To judge,however,
of the relative efficacy of the different possible situations in which
sexual preference may confer a reproductive advantage, detailed
ecological knowledge is required.

The possibility should perhaps be borne in mind in such studies
thatthemost finely adornedmalesgain some reproductiveadvantage
withouttheintervention offemalepreference,inamanner analogous
to that in which advantage is conferred by special weapons. The
establishment of territorial rights involves frequent disputes, but
these are by no means all mortal combats the most numerous, and
;
fromourpointofview, therefore, the mostimportantcases arethose
inwhichthereisno fightatall, andinwhichtheintrudingmaleisso
stronglyimpressedorintimidatedbytheappearanceofhisantagonist
as not to risk the damage of a conflict. As a propagandist the cock
behaves as though he knew that it was as advantageous to impress
the males as the females of his species, and a sprightly bearing with
fine feathers andtriumphant song are quite as well adaptedfor war-
propaganda as for courtship.

The selective action here considered combines the characteristics
ofthetwo classesto whichDarwin appliedthe term sexualselection,
namely the evolution of special weapons by combats between rival
males, and the evolution of adornments which attract or excite the
female. An appearance of strength and pugnacity is analogous to
thepossessionofthese qualitiesinproducingthesameeffect

Sex limitation of modifications
A
difficulty
whichwasregardedratherseriouslyduringthedevelop-
ment of the theory of sexual selection is implicit in the limitations
of many of the structures ascribable to sex-limited selection, to the
particular sex on which the selection acts. The difficulty lay in how
far selection acting on only one sex ought to be expected to affect
the characters of both sexes, and whether a mutation originally
affecting the development of both sexes could be confined to one
sex only, by counterselection on the other sex.

Ofthelargemutationalchanges chiefly available forgenetic study
the great majority manifest themselves equally in the two sexes ; in
animportantminoritytheeffectiseitherunequalinthetwosexesor
strictly limited to one sex. In birds and mammals a clearly under-
stood mechanism of sexual differentiation lies in the internal secre-
tionsofthegonads, whichare sexuallydifferentiated, and possiblyin
a sexual differentiation of other internal secretions. It is a natural
inferencethataproportionofthemutationswhichoccuraffectingany
givenstructurewillbe, fromthe first, sexlimitedintheirappearance,
and, iftheyproducetheireffectonlyinconjunctionwiththeinternal
secretions of the sexual glands of one sex, their appearance will be
delayed to the adult stage like the other signs of sexual maturity.

This proportion may be as low as that observed in the genetic
mutations, and indeed the only reason for thinking that it may be
higher is that these somewhat violent changes may perhaps be
expected to be produced by deviations occurring at an early stage
of development, while the slighter changes to which progress by
Natural Selection must chiefly be due may more frequently be
initiated at later developmental stages.

Whatever the frequency, however, of sex limitation, it may fairly
be inferred that selection acting upon one sex only, would, in the
complete absence of counter-selection in the other sex, lead to an
evolutionary modification not veryunequal in the two sexes. Well-
markedsexualdifferentiationmustonthisviewbe ascribedto acon-
ditionin which the selective agencies acting on the two sexes oppose
each others influence. On the view that both sexes are in most
species highly adapted to their place in nature, this situation will be
readily brought about by the selection of modifications in one sex
only, for these, in so far as they are not sex-limited, will be accom-
panied by changes in the opposite sex, which, on the assumption of
high adaptation, will generally be disadvantageous and therefore
opposed by selective agencies. Without the assumption of high
adaptation, opposition between the actions of selection on the two
sexesmustbefortuitousand
rare,
anditisbynomeansclearhowthe
widespread occurrence of sex-limited modification can on this view
be explained.

Since the whole body of genetic evidence seems to favour, and
even to require, the view that organisms are in general extremely
closely adapted to their situations, we need only consider the
consequences of this view. Selection applied to particularqualities
inone sex only will then tend, in the first instance, to modify this
sex slightly more than the other. The opposite sex will only be
modified so far as to bring into play agencies exerting selection, in
the opposite direction, and with equal intensity. The advantage of
protective coloration, stressedbyWallace, is of obvious importance
inthis connexion. Fromthispoint, whichmustbereached relatively
rapidly, onwards, the selective advantage of amutationinrespect of
theselectiveactivity underconsideration,willnotdependatallupon
theaverageofitseffectsinthetwosexes,butonlyuponthedifference
between these effects. If it enhances the sexual contrast and makes
thetwosexeslessalike,itwillbefavouredbyselection, andwillhave
thereforeadefiniteprobabilityofcontributingitsquotumtowardsthe
buildingupofsexualdifferentiation. Ifonthecontraryitseffectwould
have been to render the sexes more alike, it will be rejected by the
selectioninprogress. In this,themoreprolongedevolutionaryphase,
itshouldbenotedthatanyeffectwhichthenewmutationsmayhave
upon both sexes equally, or, infact, the average oftheireffectsupon
thetwo sexes,willbeimmediatelyneutralizedbyachangeoffrequency
in those factors which, without being sex limited, influence the
development of the organ in question.

Besides the mutations, the effects of which are conditioned by the
sexual secretions, an important class of mutations are those which
influence the nature of these secretions themselves for in the con-
;
dition of sexually opposed selections, any modification of these
secretions, which,withoutimpairingtheirnormalaction, enhancesor
increases the range of their developmental effects will thus afford
afurthermeans ofincreasing sexualdifferentiation. Inthis wayitis
by no means a supposition to be excluded as impossible that a
character at first manifested equallybythe two sexes should, bythe
actionofnaturalselection, laterbecomesex-limitedinitsappearance.

Natural Selection and the sex-ratio
The problem of the influence of NaturalSelectiononthesex-ratio
maybemostexactlyexaminedbytheaidoftheconceptofreproduc-
tivevaluedevelopedinChapterII. Asiswellknown,Darwin expressly
reserved this problem for the future as being too intricate to admit
of any immediate solution. (Descent ofMan, p. 399).

In no case, as far as we can see, would an inherited tendency to
produce both sexes in equal numbers or to produce one sex in excess,
beadirectadvantage ordisadvantagetocertainindividuals morethan
to others forinstance, anindividualwith atendencytoproduce more
;
males thanfemales wouldnot succeed betterinthe battle for life than
an individual with an opposite tendency ; and therefore a tendency of
this kind could not be gained through natural selection. Nevertheless,
there are certain animals (for instance, fishes and cirripedes) in which
two or more males appear to be necessary for the fertilization of the
female; and the males accordingly largely preponderate, but it is by
no means obvious how this male-producing tendency could have been
acquired.

Iformerlythoughtthatwhenatendencytoproducethetwo
sexesinequalnumberswasadvantageoustothespecies,itwouldfollow
from natural selection, but I now see that the whole problem is so
intricate that itis safer to leave its solution for the future.

In organisms of all kinds the young are launched upon their careers
endowed with a certain amount of biological capital derived from
theirparents. This varies enormouslyinamountin different species,
but, in all, there has been, before the offspring is able to lead an
independentexistence,acertainexpenditureofnutrimentinaddition,
almost universally, to some expenditure of time or activity, which
the parents are induced bytheirinstincts to make for the advantage
of their young. Let us consider the reproductive value of these off-
spring atthemoment whenthis parentalexpenditure ontheirbehalf
hasjust ceased. Ifwe considerthe aggregate of an entire generation
of such offspring it is clear that the total reproductive value of the
males in this group is exactly equal to the total value of all the
females, becauseeachsexmustsupplyhalfthe ancestryofallfuture
generationsofthe
species.

Fromthisitfollowsthatthesexratiowill
soadjustitself, undertheinfluenceofNaturalSelection,thatthetotal
parentalexpenditureincurredinrespectofchildrenofeachsex, shall
be equal for if this were not so andthe totalexpenditure incurred
;
inproducing males,forinstance, werelessthanthetotalexpenditure
incurred inproducingfemales,thensincethetotalreproductivevalue
ofthemalesisequaltothatofthefemales,itwouldfollowthatthose
parents, the innate tendencies of which caused them to produce
males in excess, would, for the same expenditure, produce a greater
amount of reproductive value; and in consequence would be the
progenitors of a larger fraction of future generations than would
parents having a congenital bias towards the production of females.

Selection would thus raise the sex-ratio until the expenditure upon
malesbecameequaltothatuponfemales. If,forexample, asinman,
the males suffered a heavier mortality during the period of parental
expenditure,thiswouldcausethemtobemoreexpensivetoproduce,
for, for every hundred males successfully produced expenditure
has been incurred, not only for these during their whole period of
dependance but for a certain number of others who have perished
prematurelybeforeincurringthefullcomplementofexpenditure. The
averageexpenditure is thereforegreaterforeachboyreared, butless
foreachboyborn, thanitisforgirlsatthecorrespondingstages, and
we may therefore infer that the condition toward which Natural
Selection will tend will be one in which boys are the more numerous
atbirth, butbecomelessnumerous, owingtotheirhigherdeath-rate,
before the end of the period of parental expenditure. The actual
sex-ratio in man seems to fulfil these conditions somewhat closely,
especiallyif wemakeallowanceforthelargerecent diminutionin the
deaths ofinfants and children and since this adjustment is brought
;
about by a somewhat large inequalityin thesex ratio atconception,
for which no a priorireasoncan be given, itis difficultto avoid the
conclusionthatthesex-ratiohasreally beenadjustedbythesemeans.

The sex-ratio at theendofthe periodofexpenditure thus depends
upon differential mortality during that period, and if there are any
such differences, upon the differential demands which the young of
such species make during their period of dependency ; it will not be
influenced by differential mortality during a self-supporting period ;
the relative numbers of the sexes attaining maturity may thus bo
influencedwithoutcompensation,bydifferentialmortalityduringthe
periodinterveningbetweentheperiod of dependence andthe attain-
ment of maturity. Any great differential mortality in this period
will, however, tend to be checkedbyNatural Selection, owingtothe
factthatthetotalreproductive valueofeithersex, being, duringthis
period,equaltothatoftheother, whicheveristhe scarcer, willbethe
more valuable, and consequently a more intense selection will be
exertedinfavourofallmodificationstendingtowardsitspreservation.

The numbers attaining sexual maturity may thus become unequal if
sexual differentiation in form or habits is for other reasons advan-
tageous, but any great and persistent inequality between the sexes
atmaturityshouldbefoundtobeaccompaniedbysexual differentia-
tions, having a very decided bionomic value.

## Summary

A consequenceofsexualreproductionwhichseemsto be of funda-

mental importance to evolutionary theory is that advantageous
changes in different structural elements of the germ plasm can be
taken advantage of independently whereas with asexual organisms
;
either the genetic uniformity of the whole group must be such that
evolutionary progress is greatly retarded, or if there is considerable
genetic diversity, many beneficial changes will be lost through
occurring in individuals destined to leave no ultimate descendants
in the species. In consequence an organism sexually reproduced can
respondsomuchmore rapidlytowhateverselectionisinaction, that
if placed in competition on equal terms with an asexual organism
similarinall otherrespects, thelatterwould certainlybereplacedby
the former.

In order to take full advantage of the possible occurrence of
advantageous mutations, mutation rates must be generally so low
that in the great majority of loci the homologous genes throughout
a single species are almost completely identical, and this is the con-
ditionwhichwe appearto findinthe higher organisms. With sexual
reproduction species are not arbitrary taxonomic units such as they
would be with asexual reproduction only, but are bound together
bysharing avery complete community of ancestry, if we look back
only ahundred generations. The bulkofintraspecific variance apart
from the differences between geographic races, in which some degree
of isolation has taken effect, must be ascribed to segregation during
comparatively few generations in the immediate past.

Selection acting differently on different parts of a species, whether
or not these parts are distinguished geographically, will induce
distinctions between them in the frequency with which different
genes orgene combinations occur, withoutnecessarily impairing the
unity of the species. An element of instability will, however, be
introduced in such cases, by genetic modifications affecting the
frequency of germinal interchange between the parts and this,
;
under sufficiently intense selection, will lead to the fissionofspecies,
even in the absence of geographical or other barriers to intercourse.

An important means of fission, particularly applicable to the
higheranimals,liesinthepossibilityofdifferentialsexualresponse to
fissionofspecies into parts adaptedto different habitats willalso be
favourable to the development both of discrimination and of sexual
preference.

The main postulate of Darwin'stheory of sexual selection, namely
theexercise ofsexualpreference, willthustendtobe satisfiedbythe
effects of previous selection. We may infer that the rudiments of
an aesthetic faculty so developed thus pervade entire classes,
whether or not this faculty is in fact afforded opportunities of in-
ducingevolutionarychange. In speciessosituatedthatthereproduc-
tive success of one sex depends greatly upon winning the favour of
theother, asappearsevidentlytobethecasewithmanypolygamous
birds, sexual selection will itself act by increasing the intensity of
thepreference to whichitis due, with the consequence thatboth the
feature preferred and the intensity of preference will be augmented
together with ever-increasing velocity, causing a great and rapid
evolution of certain conspicuous characteristics, until the process
can be arrested by the direct or indirect effects of Natural Selection.

Consideration ofthemechanismof sex-limitedhormones, bywhich
the secondary sexual characteristics of mammals and birds are
largelycontrolled, showsthatsexualdifferentiationmaybeincreased
ordiminished bythe action of Natural Selection, either through the
occurrence of mutations sex-limited in effect, or through a modifica-
tion of the hormone mechanism. It is thus not impossible that
amutantform, atfirstmanifestedequallybybothsexes,shouldlater,
under the action of selection, become confined to one sex only. The
question of the ratio of the sexes at maturity has not the same
importance for sexual selection as was formerly thought, at least in

tionofterritory. ItisshownthattheactionofNaturalSelectionwill

THERE arethreerespectsinwhichthetheoryofmimicryisofgreat
importance to the student ofNaturalSelection. In the first place a
greatarrayofstrikingfactsisbyitsmeansrendered
intelligible
under
the heading of a single principle; that principle being the selective
action of a single definite factor, usually predatism, in an insect's
environment, upon a single set of characters, coloration, patterning,
attitude atrest, mode offlight, observableintheinsectitself, f nour
ordinary state ofignorance as to the lives of wild creatures it fs rare
to be able to particularize, as can be done in this case, either the
incidence of an environmental factor, or the peculiar benefits of an
observed morphological or physiological characteristic.

Secondly, as has been mentioned on page 54, itisofspecial^mpor-
tance to be able to demonstrate, in any extensive group of cases, the
adaptive significance of the characteristics of species. For wjjiile it
may be true, as has been urged by Robson, that even a minute
morphological examination of the differences distinguishing closely
relatedspecies,isnotusuallycapableofrevealingtoustheiradaptive
significance in relation to their natural habitats, there can be no
doubt that the study of mimicry has shown in numerous instances
the particular environmental factor to which are to be ascribed
certain characteristics distinctive of nearly related species, sub-
species, and even of local varieties.

Thirdly, it is a matter of historical interest that the theory of
mimicry, as the greatest post-Darwinian application of Natural
Selection,playedan especiallyimportantparttowardstheendofthe
nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth century (when the
concentration of biological effort in the museums and laboratories
was beginning torenderthe conclusions of the fieldnaturalists of an
earliergenerationinpartunintelligible),bycallingconstantattention
to theimportance of ecologicalobservationsfor the interpretation of
the material gathered inthe greatmuseums.

It willbe clearlyunderstood,fromthe argumentofChapter I, that
intheopinionofthe authorthebearings ofgeneticaldiscoveries, and
in particular of the Mendelian scheme of inheritance, upon evolu-
tionary theory, is quite other than, and indeed opposite to, that
whichthepioneers ofMendelism originally tookittobe. Thesewere
already, at the time of the rediscovery of Mendel's work, in the full
current of that movement of evolutionary thought, which in the
ninetiesofthelastcenturyhadsetininfavourofdiscontinuousorigin
for specific forms. It was natural enough therefore that the discon-
tinuous elements in Mendelism should, without sufficiently critical
scrutiny, have been interpreted as affording decisive evidence in
favour of this view\ Nowhere perhaps in biology has this current of
opinionintroducedsuchseriousdiscrepancies, asintheinterpretation
of mimetic resemblance.

Theories of Bates and Miiller
The theory of Bates, put forward inj.861, implies no more than
is readily understood from the term mimicry ; namely that certain
palatable forms, which Bates observed especially among butterflies,
being preyed upon by insect-eating birds, are so placed that it is
advantageous for them to be mistaken for other objects, especially
less palatable forms, which they somewhat resemble and that the
;
selective advantageso conferred uponthoseindividuals inwhomthe
resemblance is most complete, has led these species to become more
andmore
perfect
mimicsofotherspeciesinhabitingthesame
district,
relatively immuneto attack, andtherefore appropriate models. This
theory depends on the errors of the predators, but on errors of the
senses only, not ofthe judgement. The choice of food made by the
bird may be made by instinct, perfect, though latent, in the egg, or
may be the result of experience. In the latter case no account is
takenofthe stages during whichthe experienceisgathered, butonly
ofthefinalstage whentheeducationiscomplete and a correct judge-
ment as to diet finally formed. The eye may still be deceived; it
is the essence of Bates's theory that it should be exposed to decep-
tion ; but errors of judgement have no place in the theory.

Whether it be supposed to be fixed by heredity, or to be open to
modificationbyexperience,thejudgementofthepredatordoesimpose
one limitation upon Bates's theory. If hereditary it must have been
moulded by Natural Selection, as a system offood preferences ad-
vantageous to the species, and could not long continue to apply to
those particular situations in which the loss due to rejecting mimics
actuallyoutweighedtheadvantageofrejectingthemodels. Thesame
consequencefollows, only more immediately, ifindividualexperience
isthebasisofthejudgementformed. It must be assumed, therefore,
that the mimics are sufficiently rare, or the models sufficiently
noxious, for it to be advantageous for the predator to reject the
models, together with a certain proportion of deceptive mimics, on
those occasions on which a discriminative rejection is practised or
;
alternatively,toassumethatthestateofaffairsobservedisatransient
one,pendingamore perfectadaptationofthepredator'sinstincts. In
point of fact the conclusion was early drawn by Bates, and widely
accepted, thatthe mimic must be acomparativelyrarespecies, gain-
ing its advantage through resemblance to a highly protected and
abundant species inhabiting the same region.

A limitationofasimilarkind,butofasomewhatdifferentspecifica-
tion,isimposedbythereactionofthemodel. Theresemblancewhich

to the model. An individual of the model species may suffer from
being mistaken for a mimic, and as the probability of this is least
whentheresemblanceisleast, selectionwilltendtomodifythemodel
soastorenderitdifferentfromthemimicasconspicuouslyaspossible.

This situation is not essentially different from that which gives rise
to warning colours generally, for to be recognized as unpalatable
is equivalent to avoiding confusion with palatable species. Close
Batesian mimicry can therefore only be established if the rate of
modification of the model has been less than that of the mimic, and
this may be taken, in terms of the predominant factors of the situa-
tion,toimplythattheselectiveadvantageconferredontheindividual
mimic, exceedstheselective disadvantage suffered bythe individual
model. Disparity in numbers is as useful in ensuring the fulfilment
of this condition as it is in satisfying that imposed by the feeding
proclivities of the predator.

The observation, which was familiar to Bates, of the close super-
ficial resemblance between very abundant, and apparently equally
protected, species, led Miiller eighteen years later toformulatewhat
has been called the Mullerian, as opposed to the Batesian, theory of
mimicry, a term which it is still convenient to apply, although, as
Professor Poulton has pointed out, the term mimicry should in
strictnessbeconfinedtothetheoryofBates. Miiller'stheoryinvolves,
more than does that of Bates, a consideration of the ecological
situation in which the destruction of butterflies by birds actually
occurs. He points out that young birds, at least, do in fact learn
much by experience, and that during this process of self education
in what isandwhat is not good to eat, the total destructionsuffered
bytwo unpalatable species willbe diminished and ultimatelyhalved,
if they come gradually to resemble one another so closely that the
lesson of avoidance learnt from the one will be equally applicable to
the other. An extension of the notion of education in this argument
was pointed out in 1915 by C. F. M. Swynnerton, who, on the basis
of very detailed observations, together with extensive experiments,
on the preferences of insect-eating birds, considers that, owing to a
partialfailureofvisualmemory,theprocessofeducationiscontinued
throughout life by encountering, without necessarily attacking, the
aposematic typos andthatthegreaterthenumbers showing agiven

warning colour, the more frequently is the memory reinforced, and,
in consequence, actually fewer mistaken attacks are made.

The Batesian mimic gains its advantage at the expense of the
predator whichit deceives, andof the model whose life it endangers.

both kinds of prey to establish the Mullerian relationship, which is
to the advantage of all three, while model and predator will both
tend to diminish the advantage of the Batesian mimic, the first by
directly diminishing the resemblance, the other by modification of
feeding habits and by increasingly keen discrimination. The last
tendency, while diminishing the advantage of resemblance of any
givendegree,will,however,tendtoincreasethedegreeofresemblance
Supposed statistical limitation of Mullerian theory
It has been seen that the reactions of model and predator impose
a statistical limitation upon the theory of Bates, of which the prin-
cipal observable factor is the relative abundance of the species. It
hasbeensupposed, andthesuppositionhasbeenfrequentlyrepeated,
that a similar limitation inheres in the theory of Miiller. In 1908
G. A. K. Marshall suggested that, for arithmetical reasons, of two
equally unpalatable species inhabiting the same region the less
numerous will tend to resemble the more numerous, while the more
numerous will not reciprocate this tendency. Marshall does not
suggestthatthemorenumerouswilltendtodecreasetheresemblance.

The general purport of his paper is to emphasize the Batesian as
opposed to the Mullerian factor in resemblance, and that principally
forreasons otherthanthatunderdiscussion. The frequentrepetition
of his statistical argument gives this point a special importance,
and it will be examined here since it is eminently of the type to
which mathematical reasoning should be able to supply a decisive
answer.

When no question of degree is introduced into the discussion
nothing is clearer than the distinction between the Batesian and the
Mullerian factors. If, however, we take into consideration that
butterfliesmayexistinalldegrees ofpalatability, andthatavoidance
oracceptancebythepredator mustdependgreatlyuponitsappetite,
there is some danger that the distinctness of the evolutionary ten-
dencies pointed out by these two authors may be lost in the com-
plexity of the actual biological facts. This is necessarily the case in
the discussion of separate aspects of Natural Selection. An evolu-
tionary tendency is perceived intuitively, and expressed in terms
which simplify, andthereforenecessarilyfalsify, theactualbiological
facts. The onlyreality whichstandsbehindsuchabstracttheoriesis,
in each case, the aggregate of all the incidents of a particular kind,
which canoccurfrom momenttomomenttomembers of a speciesin
the course of their life-histories.

In order to show how these incidents may be specified let us
imagine three species, occupying the same region, of which A is
highly unpalatable, B less so, while C is free from objectionable
qualities. Thenall possible situations may be exhaustively classified
given for the occurrence of any situation (a, 6, c), are by no means
exhaustive, but might conceivably be much elaborated by detailed
biological observations.

I. A, B, and C all liable to attack.

II. B and C liable to attack, but not A.

A
(a) bird which, either by inheritance or sufficient experience,
prefers B to A is ready to attack an object recognized as B and not
to attack an object recognized as A.

(6) A bird has attacked A and found it to be unpalatable, but has
not yet had sufficiently impressed upon its mind the unpalatable
qualities of B.

III. A and C liable to attack, but not B.

(c) A bird has attacked B and found it to be unpalatable, but has
not yet had sufficiently impressed upon its mind the unpalatable
qualities of A.

IV. C only liable to attack.

In situation I, mimetic resemblance is without effect, while in
situationIV, C wouldgainby beingmistakenfor A orB, andA or B
wouldlose bybeingmistakenforC. C might, therefore, iftheformer
effectwere to exceed the latter, become a Batesian mimic of A or B,
while, on the contrary, A and B would gain by emphasizing their

is the case both A and B willseem,therefore, to be acted upon by
;
opposing tendencies, one tending towards similarity, and the other
towards dissimilarity. It is only when the situations are analysed
intotheirsuggestedcausesthatitispossibletoindicatetheresultant

Forthispurpose we distinguishthe 'Batesiansituation'II
(a),
from
the 'Miillerian situations' 11(6) and III(c), recognizing that this
classification need not be exhaustive. It is then seen that Batesian
situations are to be distinguished by (i) depending upon differences
of palatability and (ii) producing a 'Batesian tendency' for B to
approach A and for A to recede from B. While the Miillerian situa-
tions (6) and (c) do not depend upon any difference of palatability,
but are taken to occur whenever both species are, on occasion,
In the occurrence of situation II in which a bird will attack one
form, butwillnotattackthe other, the differencebetweentheaction
of the Mullerian and the Batesian factor could only be discerned by
an observer who knew whether the bird's judgement, admittedly
right, was founded upon sufficient or insufficient experience. If the
experience is sufficient the bird would never prefer A to B (situation
III), consequently he would create only Batesian situations ; while
ifhis experience is insufficient we must admit that it might have led
him to create situation III, and that even when he creates situation
II, that situation is none the less Mullerian. As a Batesian agent a
bird is always rightinhis judgement
;
as a Mullerian agenthemaybe
right, but in view of his inexperience, he has no right to be right. If
the bird, as is usually the case with man, has only partially satis-
factory grounds for his judgement, he may inthesameactbebotha

formed by all occasions of the two appropriate kinds that the two
evolutionary tendencies are completely distinct. Further study and
thought devotedtothehabits ofwild animals maythus enable other
tendencies to be recognized.

Itisnot,however, obviousfrom the analysisdeveloped abovethat
theneteffect of (6) and (c) willbetocause amutual, thoughpossibly
unequal, approach between the two species, such as Miillerinferred.

Itis Marshall's contention that when the unpalatability is equal, the
lessnumerous specieswillbeattractedbythegreater, butthegreater
willnot be attractedbytheless. Marshall doesnotfailtodrawfrom
this conclusion a very important consequence, for, as he points out,
his premises lead to the inevitable result that, when a mimetic
similarity is once effected, the larger species will have gained the
smallershare,butstillashare,ofadvantagefromtheassociation, and
one might be inclined to argue from this that the larger species also
will be led to approach this more advantageous condition. The far-
reaching conclusion is drawn that such an argument is not valid,
unless a continuous path from the first state to the second can be
shown to exist, such that the advantage increases for each step
along the path. Such a restriction, if necessary, would throw upon
the selectionist an onus of detailed demonstration, which his op-
ponent might increase indefinitely by challenging the details with
increasing minuteness. Even if the case of Mullerian mimicry were
notinitselfofsufficientimportance, itwouldbeessentialtoexamine
in some detail the particular case in which the argument from ulti-
mate advantage is believed to lead to an erroneous conclusion.

Marshall's argument is essentially as follows, if A and B are two
equally distasteful species, of which B is the less numerous, then, in
theabsenceofmistakesduetotheresemblanceofthetwo species,the
young birds will take a proportionately heavier toll of B than of A,
before they have alllearnt theirlesson consequently any mutant of
;
A whichresembles B willsuffermorethanthe non-mutant type, and
in consequence willbe eliminated. It willbe seen that the mutant is
supposedtolose the wholeofthe advantage ofthe warningcolourA,
andinreturntoreceiveonlythelessadvantageofthewarningcolour
B, andthisargumentisindeedconclusiveinshowingthatamutation,
which leaps clear outside the protective influence of its type, will
suffer heavily for its rashness, even if, miraculously enough, its leap
lands it in the heart of the protective influence of a less numerous
aposeme. But whatofalessviolent mutation ? Isit possible to gain
some of the advantage of resembling B without losing the whole of
the advantage of resembling A ? Is it even possible that increased
shelter from aposeme B will more than counterbalance the loss from
decreased shelter from aposeme A ? In his answer to Marshall's
argumentDixeyputsforwarda directlyoppositesupposition, namely
that a mutant of appearance intermediate between A and B, would
gain the full advantage of both resemblances. In fact, whereas
Marshall assumes that the whole of the advantage of resembling A
B
is lost before any of the advantage of resembling is gained, Dixey
assumes, on the contrary, that the whole of the advantage of re-
sembling B may be gained before any advantage of resembling A is
lost. Both are clearly extreme assumptions ; neither can be true
generally, andsincethetwo assumptionsleadtooppositeconclusions
it would seem, so far as these arguments carry us, that we are faced
with a balance of forces of unknown magnitude, and can neither
assert that the Miillerian principle will work, nor that it will fail.

There remains the argument upon which Miiller relied, that the
final condition of close resemblance being beneficial to both species,
both will therefore tend to approach this advantageous condition.

Marshallchallengesthelegitimacyofthis argument, hisreasonbeing
thepowerfulonethathehas disprovedthe conclusionin aparticular
instance; as we have seen, however, Marshall's argument in the
chosen instance is indecisive, and the general argument from the
3653 v
advantage ofthe final state isin a position to reassert its claims. If
it is conclusive, however, it should be possible to devise a form of
argumentwhich shallshow unequivocally, on the agreed postulates,
thattheadmittedMiilleriansituationwillinfactproduce a Miillerian
evolutionary tendency affecting both species concerned.

Such an argument may, I suggest, be constructed by comparing
the fate of any deviation from the type A, not with the average of
that type, but with an equally conspicuous but opposite deviation.

It will be admitted that variations of the species A, whether due to
mutation orto Mendelian recombination, will be equally frequent in
the direction of B as in the opposite direction; we may, therefore,
without error, consider such variations to occur in pairs comprising
variations of equal magnitude, but in opposite directions.

Since they are of equal magnitude they will lose (if anything)
equally by failing to be recognized as typically A, but if either, or
both,areevermistakenforspeciesB,thegreaterbenefitwillcertainly
be reaped by the variation in the direction of B. Since the whole
species may be regarded as made up of such pairs of variations, and
since in every pair selection favours the one more like B, if either is
favoured, the net resultant must be a modification in the direction
of species B.

It will be seen that the condition for the existence of a mimetic
tendency is that in a certain proportion of the situations in which A
is liable to, but B is immune against attack, members of species A
should, through their similarity to B, actually escape attack. This is
somewhat differentfromthe condition arrived atbyProfessor H. H.

Turner, in his appendix to Poulton's Memoir on Mimicry in the
ButterfliesofFiji, 1924, who speaks of an actual overlapofthe varia-
tions of the two species as the condition for the efficacy of Mutter's
statistical argument. The possibility of error on the part of the
predatorseems anessentialfeaturein mimicrytheory, andallowance
can be made for it in Turner's treatment, provided we interpret his
distributioncurvesasreferring, nottotheobjectivevariabilityofthe
species, but to the (probably much greater) variability of the preda-
tor's subjective impressions, influenced as these must often be by
inattention or haste, and by deceptive orinsufficient illumination
infact,bywhatevercircumstances conducetoerror, humanoravian,
It is rather remarkable that, on a subject so remote from direct
evidence as the subjective impressions of birds, we should possess
three good reasons for assuming an approximately normal distribu-
tion : (a) that the reasons for which this distributionis chosen as the
*normal law of errors' can scarcely be confined tomankind, (6) that
the objective variability of a measurable character due either to
Mendelian segregation, or to environmental fluctuations, is usually
closelynormal,and
(c)
thattheresultantcompoundedoftwoindepen-
dent distributions isnecessarily more normalthan one, and possibly
than both of its components.

The argument developed above may assuredly be refuted by dis-
proving any ofthe biologicalfactors assumedinthe discussion. Ifit
were proved that situations neverinfact arise in which a memberof

blance are not heritable, then the Miillerian theory of mimicry
wouldfail as anexplanation of the resemblances observed. The sole
point established by the above reasoning is that if these biological
factors are admitted the resulting evolutionary tendency cannot be
confined to the less numerous of two species. The efficiency of
Miillerian selectionwilldoubtless be greater (ceterisparibus) withthe

The number of species involved, among the insects alone, is so
great that in the majorityof individual cases many classes of appro-
priate observations are lacking, and the probable explanation must
thereforebejudgedfromincompleteevidence, inthelight of casesof
which more is known.

a human inventor, on simple and effective mechanical, physical, or

importance of the facts grouped under (ii) lies not in their value as

survey of the phenomenon of mimicry as a whole.

Plates I and II, from examples chosen by Professor Poulton, will
serve to exemplify the kinds of superficial similarities, which form
the observational basis of the theory. While these are sufficient to
illustrate some characteristics of the evidence, familiarity with the
living animal and its ecological associates is of special importance in
these studies.

To distinguish whether an observed resemblance is to be ascribed
to the Batesian or to the Miillerian evolutionary tendencies, or to
both acting simultaneously, or, as in the case of the ant parasites
mentioned above, to some distinct type of selective action, appears
to be a much more difficult matter. Although Miillerian selection,
unlike that of Bates, causes a mutual approach of the two species;
we can scarcely expect that their modifications will be sufficiently
nearly equal, save in a small minority of cases, for both to be made
apparent by comparison with related species. In the majority of
cases modification will be manifest on phylogenetic grounds only in
thosespecies whichhavebecomemost rapidlymodified. Thecriterion
of palatability seems even more difficult to apply; for though the
principle of Bates is excluded when two species are actually equally
acceptable or unacceptable, to demonstrate such equality with
sufficient precision to exclude differential predatism, and to demon-
strate it with respect to the effectual predatory population, would
seemtorequirebothnaturalknowledgeandexperimentalrefinement
which we do not at present possess. It is perhaps from the lack of
more clearly decisive means of discrimination, that reliance has been
placed upon observations of relative abundance, which, though
clearly relevant to the problem, are not in themselves sufficient to
supply a final test. Batesian mimicry by a more numerous of a less
numerous form, cannot be excluded as impossible on purely theor-
eticalgrounds forifthe modelwereextremelynoxiousorthemimic
;
a not particularly valuable source of food, the motive for avoidance
may be but little diminished bythe increase of the mimic. Moreover
it is not so much abundance relative to the entomological collector,
as abundance relative to selective agents of unknown species, and
whose habits andtimes offeeding are therefore alsounknown, which
has to be considered, when this argument is used to exclude the
Batesian principle. Equally, demonstrable differencesinpalatability
do not, as has been seen, serve to exclude the Mullerian factor, the
potency of which appears to be manifest when similar warning
patterns are adopted by a group of several different and remotely
relatedspeciesinthesamedistrict.

A distinction between the kind of resemblance attained by the
Batesian and Mullerian factors might be theoretically inferred in
cases in which the group of predators is confronted with only one or
the other type of resemblance. Since the Batesian resemblance is
deceptive, it should extend to every observable character, at least
in so far that no conspicuous differences remain by which the mimic
mightbedistinguished fromthemodel. Thisisnotanecessityforthe

The evolution of distastefulness
An importantquestionraisedbyboththeBatesianandtheMullerian
theories of mimicryconcernstheprocessbywhichnauseousflavours,
as a means of defence, have been evolved. Most other means of
defence such as stings, or disagreeable secretions and odours, are
explicable byincreasing the chance oflife of theindividualsinwhich
they are best developed, or ofthe social community to which they
belong. With distastefulness, however, although it is obviously
capable of giving protection to the species as a whole, through its
effectupontheinstinctiveoracquiredresponsesofpredators,yetsince
anyindividualtastedwouldseemalmostboundtoperish,itisdifficult
to perceive how individual increments of the distasteful quality,
beyondthe average level of the species, could confer any individual
advantage.

The gregarious habit of certain larvae supplies a possible solution
oftheproblem,if wearewillingtoaccepttheviewthatthedistasteful
quality of the imago, which warning colours are so well adapted to
advertise, is itself merely a by-product due to the persistence of
nauseous substances acquired through the protection afforded to the
larva. For, although with the adult insect the effect of increased
distastefulness upon the actions of the predator will be merely to
make that individual predator avoid all members of the persecuted
species, and so, unless the individual attacked possibly survives, to
confer no advantage upon its genotype, with gregarious larvae the
effect will certainly be to give the increased protection especially to
one particular group of larvae, probably brothers and sisters of the
individual attacked. The selective potency of the avoidance of
brothers will of course be only half as great as if the individual itself
wereprotected
;
againstthisistobesetthefactthatitappliestothe
whole of a possibly numerous brood. There is thus no doubt of the
real efficacy of this form of selection, though it may well be doubted
if all cases of insect distastefulness can be explained by the same
principle.

Professor Poulton has informed me that distasteful and warningly
colouredinsects,even butterflies, have suchtough andflexible bodies
that they can survive experimental tasting without serious injury.

Without the weight of his authority I should not have dared to
suppose that distasteful flavours in the body fluids could have been
evolved by the differential survival of individuals in such an ordeal.

The effect of selection on gregarious larvae, while not excluding
individual selection of the imago, provides an alternative which will
certainlybeeffectiveinausefullylargeclassofcases.

The institution of well defined feeding territories among many
birds in the breeding season makes it possible to extend the effect
produced on gregarious larvae to other cases in which the larvae,
while notgregarious inthe sense ofswarming on the same plant, are
yet distributed in an area which ordinarily falls within the feeding
territory of a single pair. The selective effect in such cases will be
diluted in so far as larvae of other broods may fall within the same
territory,
andwillshareintheadvantageordisadvantageoccasioned
by the high or low development of distastefulness of any larvae
tasted within this area. Such dilution willcertainly make slowerthe
evolution ofdistastefulness, itsspeed, if we oversimplifytheproblem
by supposing that a number of broods chosen at random share a
common reputation, being inversely proportional to the number of
broods
;
dilutionofaselectiveeffect,should,however,notbeconfused
with a counteracting tendency, which might bring progress to a
standstill. The laying habits of several moths with conspicuous,
thoughscattered,larvaedeserveattentioninthisrespect.

Theviewthatnauseousflavourshave
generally
beenacquiredbythe
effects of selection acting upon related larvae living in propinquity,
impliesthat gregariousness, orequivalent habits, were formerlyused
by species which are now distasteful, though it does not imply that
species with distasteful and even conspicuous larvae should neces-
sarily have retained the gregarious habit ; for the advantages of this
habit, among which we may surmise (i) the reduced exposure of the
female during oviposition, and (ii) in the case of distasteful and
conspicuous larvae the advantage of increased protection from
predators, will not always counterbalance the disadvantage some-
times entailed by a depletion of thefood-supply. We may, however,
fairly infer that if gregarious or equivalent habits are a necessary
condition for the development of protective flavours, and if the
possession of such flavours gives an added advantage, both to the
gregarious habit, and to conspicuous coloration, then some associa-
tion should be observable in nature between the conspicuousness of
the larvae, and the habit of laying the whole brood either in great
numbers on a single plant, or on neighbouring plants. The subject
is one on which a comprehensive summary of the biological facts is
much to be desired. I am indebted to Professor Poulton and Dr
A. D. Imms for the following instances.

The Buff -tip moth Zygaera bucephala is distasteful alike as larva,
pupa, and imago. The caterpillar is conspicuouslyyellow andblack,
and strikingly gregarious, the pupa is brown and buried, though
equally distasteful, and the perfect moth is a beautiful example of
cryptic coloration. Since the distastefulness is thus only advertised
in the larval stage it may well have been developed by selection in
thisstageonly,aprocesscertainlyfacilitatedbyitsgregarioushabits.

The Gothic moth, Mania typica is also unpalatable at all stages ; in
this case the larvae are not conspicuous, but feed when small in
companies on the under sides of leaves.

The hairy rather brightly coloured caterpillars of Onethocampa
processioned live in communal webs. When they have eaten the
foliage enclosed inthewebtheymarchoutinlarge 'processions', and
seekout asiteforanewweb. Whenoldertheysally out atduskand
break into small parties to feed, returning to the communal web
before daylight; they seem instinctively to avoid solitude as if it
were a danger. These caterpillars exhibit a number of features, the
web, the avoidance of daylight, and the fear of solitude, each of
which may be interpreted as affording some measure of protection
against different predators.

Conspicuous larvae of butterflies and moths are generally grega-
rious though not always so. An apparent exception is afforded by
the Magpie moth Abraxas grossulariata of which the larvae feed
separately ; the eggs, however, are laid ingroups, and the larvae are
numerousonthesamebush, oronadjacentbushes. Anosiaplexippus
however, scatters her eggs, although she has solitary, inedible, con-
spicuous, larvae. This is probably true of many Danaines.

which fly over considerable distances, while those with sluggish
females may have scattered, though not widely scattered larvae.

An instructive case is afforded by the Peacock andTortoise-shell
butterflies, Vanessa, and related genera. These are swift fliers, and
theirlarvae might, therefore, be widely scattered. In the true genus
Vanessa the larvae are conspicuous, andtheeggs are laid in batches,
whereasin the Painted Lady Cynthia cardui, and the Red Admiral
Pyrameis atalanta, formerly placed in Vanessa, the larvae are partly
concealed and the eggs are laid singly.

Larvae of many Chrysomelid beetles are gregarious, and some of
these at least are notably distasteful.

Of Saw-flylarvae Cameron says those 'which give out secretions
orfetid odours aregregarious, severalfeeding onthe same leaf, often
ranged in a row with their bodies stuck out in the air. They have
nearly always bright colours'. The advantage of gregariousness in
strengthening these means of defence is obvious; they may be
regardedasdevelopmentsofthepassivedefenceaffordedbynauseous
flavours, and it is in the initial stages of this development that the
gregarioushabitseemstosupplytheconditionforeffective selection.

In general it may be said that the observational facts in this field
areconsistentwith, andlendsome supporttotheview,that, whereas
offensive flavours supplythe conditionforthe evolutionary develop-
mentofwarningcolours, andpresumablyalso ofwarningodours,the
condition for the evolutionary development of offensive flavours,
which may equally characterize all stages of the life history, is to be
found in the gregariousness or propinquity of larvae of the same
brood, andtherefore of somewhat highly correlated genetic constitu-
tion. A much wider knowledge of the observational facts than the
author possesses would, however, be needed, before it could be as-
sertedthat no alternative view wouldsufficetoexplaintheevolution
of distastefulness, as a means of defence.

The principle deduced in this section of the selective advantage
sharedbyagroupofrelatives, owingtotheindividualqualitiesofone
ofthegroup, who enjoysnopersonalselectiveadvantage,isanalogous
to the situation which arises in human communities, in the tribal
state of organization, in the selection of the group of qualities which
may be summed up as heroism. The ideal of heroism has been
developed among such peoples considerably beyond the optimum of
personal advantage, and its evolution is only to be explained, in
terms ofknown causes, bythe advantagewhichit confers, byrepute
and prestige, upon the kindred of the hero. The human situation,
which will be analysed in more detail in Chapter XI is, however,
certainly complicated by sexual selection, of which there is no
evidenceinthecaseoftheevolutionof distastefulqualitiesininsects.

The theory of saltations
In his book onMimicry inButterflies, 1915, Punnett repeats Mar-
shall's argument, and concludes without reservation that Miillerian
mimicry of a less numerous by a more numerous species is excluded
by it. At first sight the argument appears irrelevant to Punnett's
main contention of the inadequacy of Natural Selection to produce
adaptations,forhe evidently, unlikeMarshall, would rejectalsoboth
Batesian mimicry, andthe Miillerian mimicryofthe more numerous
bythelessnumerous
species.

Nevertheless,itwouldnotbealtogether
fair to regard Punnett's citation of Marshall's argument as a merely
extraneous addition to his indictment, such as by arousing suspicion
oferror,thoughonanirrelevantissue,mightservetosecureaverdict
on the main count; on the contrary, Marshall's argument plays a
small yet essential part in his destructive argument derived from
mimicry rings. The case of two presumably palatable female types
each quite unlike the corresponding males, which males are unlike
each other, is chosen to illustrate this difficulty. The two females
show an apparent mimetic resemblance to three other butterflies,
tworegardedasdefinitelyunpalatableandthethirdasdoubtfullyso.

Assuming that the non-mimetic males represent the former appear-
ance ofthetwomimeticfemales, itisaskedhowthelatterhavecome
to resemble the distasteful members of the ring. Granted that these

It will be seen that for Punnett's argument on this important
point, the gradual and mutual convergence of two or more different
warningcoloursmustbewhollyexcluded,forifthepossibilityofsuch
aprocessisadmitted,thedifficultyofimaginingacontinuoussequence
of changes entirely disappears, while onthe contrary the assumption
of discontinuity becomes a burden upon the theory, involving as it
does the definite improbability of hitting oft" a good resemblance at
one shot. Consequently Marshall's argument, which Punncttseems
to have taken as reimposing all the limitations of the Batesian
situation, plays an essentialpart in the argument in favour of salta-
tions soessentialindeedthatitseemsimpossibletorepairthebreach
;
made by its removal.

The case for saltations as presented by Punnett was not entirely
negative and destructive in character; it embodied one (then)
recently discovered fact of considerable interest, namely that the
differences between the three forms of the trimorphic female of
Papilio polytes could be ascribed to two Mendelian factors, both
limitedintheir obvious effectstothefemale sex, andone apparently
necessary for the manifestation of the second.

This fact is of importance as indicating the mechanism by which
a clearpolymorphism is maintained it shows that polymorphism in
;
this case, and probablyinsimilarcases, is dependent on one ormore
Mendelianfactors the function of which is to switch on one or other
ofthe possible alternatives, just as the more widespread dimorphism
of sex is also dependent upon the Mendelian mechanism. In some
groups, e.g. Drosophila andMan, a whole chromosome is utilized in
the process of sex determination, in some fishes, on the contrary,
crossingoverhasbeenfoundtooccurbetweentheesex-chromosomes'
in the heterogamctic sex, whether male as in Lebistes, or female as
inPlatypoecilus in fishes it appears that we ought more properly to
;
speak of the sex-gene rather than the sex-chromosome as the agent
of sex determination. The passage from the one condition to the
other, by the cessation of crossing over, presents no inherent diffi-
culties, especially as Mendelian factors are known which expedite or
inhibitcrossingover. Thereasonforsuchachangeisnotso obvious,
but since both systems arefound stillinuse, it is probable that each
has, upon particular conditions, its own advantages.

The core of Punnett's argument in favour of the production of
mimetic forms by saltations lies in the Mendelian behaviour of the
polymorphic females, for it is argued that these Mendelian factors
musthavearisenoriginallyasmutations,and seeingthatthedifferent
forms demonstrably differ by only single factor differences, these
types must have sprung into existence each at a single leap. Con-
vincingasthisargumentatfirstsightseems, weshould,nevertheless,
at once recognize our fallacy if we argued that because the sex
difference in the fish Lebistes is apparently determined by a single
factor, therefore a female fish of that genus, with the appropriate
adaptationsofhersexhadarisenby a single saltationfrom a male of
the same species! Or vice versa. In this case we are freed evenfrom
the necessity of rejecting the supposed saltation as improbable, for
sincethereproductionofthespeciesrequirestheco-operationofboth
sexes, we may be certain that the origin of the sex factor antedated
the evolution of separate sexes, and has presumably persisted, in
its function of switch, unchanged during the whole course of the
evolutionary development of these two types.

Theexampleofsexemphasizesstronglythefact, whichisbecoming
more and more appreciated as genetical research is more applied to
complexand practicalproblems,thatitisthefunctionofaMendelian
factor to decide between two (or more) alternatives, but that these
alternatives may each be modified in the course of evolutionary
development, so that the morphological contrast determined by the
factor at a late stage may be quite unlike that which it determined
atitsfirstappearance. The inference,therefore,thatbecausea
factor determines the difference between a mimetic and a male-like
form in P. polytes, therefore the mimetic form arose fully developed
bya singlemutation,isonethatcannotfairly bedrawn
;
itrequires,in
fact,thegratuitousassumptionthatnoevolutionarychangehastaken
place in either of the two alternative forms since the dimorphism
was first established.

Certain genetical experiments have demonstrated that genetic
changes of the kind here considered are compatible with a purely
Mendelian scheme of inheritance. In rats, the hooded (black and
white) patternis asimplerecessive tothe 'self' or 'solid' coloration ;
the case is probably parallel to the *Dutch' pattern in rabbits, and
the *recessive pied' in mice. In studying variations in the hooded
pattern Castle found that by selection it was easy to obtain strains
of hooded rats which were almost entirely black, and other strains
almost entirely white, and equally, of course, a large number of
stable patterns of an intermediate character. All these types of
*hooded' behaved, as before selection, as simply recessive to self-
colour. Two possible explanations were put forward ; the first pos-
sibility was that the modification produced by selection lay in the
hooded gene, that, in fact, selection had sorted out from a large
number of slightly differing allelomorphs, those favouring much or
little pigmentation, and consequently that the surviving hooded
genes were different from those prevalent before selection. The
second
possibility
wasthatthehoodedgenewasinvariableincharac-
ter, but that the pigmented area depended also on the co-operation
ofothergenes,so-calledmodifyingfactors, andthatthechangeinthe
hooded pattern was the result of selection among the alternatives
presented by these modifiers, of those types which developed larger
or smaller pigmented areas respectively. A crucial experiment was
devised to decide between these possibilities. Rats of both selected
lines were bred backto unselected selfs, the young were inbred, and
the hooded pattern was recoveredin the grandchildren ; if the modi-
fication had taken place in the hooded gene the recovered hooded
ratswouldhavereceivedfully modifiedhooded
genes,
andmusthave
been as dark, or as light, as the hooded line from which they were
obtained; but, if other factors were responsible, the hooded grand-
children would have received these equally from their self and from
theirhooded
grand-parents,
andwouldconsequentlybelessextremely
dark or light than the latter. The second alternative was proved to
be correct, the modification being readily transmitted by self rats
whichcontainednohooded gene. The gene,then,maybetakentobe
uninfluenced by selection, but its external effect may be influenced,
apparently to any extent, by means of the selection of modifying
factors.

Unless these analogies are wholly misleading, we should suppose
that the factors H and R which Fryer found to determine the
differences between the polymorphic forms of P. polytes, each arose
suddenly by a mutation, and that the new genes so produced have
been entirely unmodified since their first appearances. On the other
hand, weshouldseenoreasonwhateveron geneticgroundstobelieve
that the combination HHrr on its first appearance at all closely

Stability of the gene-ratio
It should be emphasized that there is nothing in the argument
developed above which helps to explain polymorphism itself. The
phenomenonissufficiently uncommontosuggestthatitmustalways
owe its origin to some rather special circumstances; however, the
Mendelian character of the phenomenon does suggest one short step
in the direction of a solution, namely, that the underlying condition
for its development is that the proportionate numbers of the genes
of someMendelianfactor, having a fairly marked effect, shouldbein
stable equilibrium, such as that considered in Chapter V.

Stabilizing selection can scarcely be other than exceptional, yet it

A
only, should not be dimorphic unless additional causes of stability
are at work, for apart from these the selection produces an unstable
equilibrium, from which the ratio will continue to depart until one
or other type is exterminated.

A second form of stabilizing action is found in reproductive
selection. The stableratio ofthe sexesis clearly duetothis cause, as
isthatofthethrum -eyed and pin-eyedprimroses. Itisinterestingto
note that Fryer, in his breeding experiments with Papilio polytes
observed numerous cases of sterile unions, which suggested to him
the possible existence of ' illegitimate' pairings. One ofthe simplest
possibilities of this type is a merely greater fertility of the hetero-
zygous as compared to the homozygous condition.

It should perhaps be noted that Gerould's work, on the dominant
white observedinthefemale of several species of Colias, also reveals
some peculiar features suggestive ofa stability mechanismgoverning
the yellow-white gene-ratio. Gerould reports that great difficulties
were encountered in obtaining the homozygous white types, these
difficultiesbeingevidentlyconnectedwiththeoccurrenceof a closely
linked lethal factor. When pure white broods had been obtained,
fromastrainapparentlyfreedfromthelethal,thefailureofthemales
to mate causedtheintroduction of wildmales, andthese werefound
to bring in the lethal factor. The fact that this particular lethal is
apparentlynotrareinnature, although weshouldexpectittodieout
somewhat rapidly,suggeststhata stabilizingsystemmustbepresent.

The genetic complexities are not fully elucidated, for certain types
of mating seem regularlyto give an abnormal sex-ratio (3 $ : 2 $).

Itis interestingin connexion with the modifying effects of selection,
that Gerould notes the occurrence of a fluctuating tinge of yellow
onthewingofthegeneticallywhitefemale,andascribesitsvariability
to secondaryfactors.

Both the white form in Colias and the two mimetic forms of
polytes are confined to the females, and in both sexes the mutant
formis dominant to the older gene from which itpresumablyarose.

This circumstance, together with the probability in both cases of
stability of the gene ratio, suggests that the mutantform enjoys a
selective advantage, and has for this reason been acquired by the
heterozygote,
andthattheselectivedisadvantageofthemutantgene
is confined to the reproductive factor of genetic lethality or sterility
associated with the mutant homozygote. In the case of the mimetic
forms of P. polytes, their selective advantage had already been
inferredbystudentsofmimicry,thoughwhetherthewhiteColiascan
be brought under the same principle appears to be doubtful. If,
however, this surmise as to the causes of genetic stability should be
proved correct, these and analogous cases should provide an unex-
ampledopportunityofactuallyassessingthemagnitudeofaparticu-
lar selective agency in nature. For reproductive causes of selection,
especially if dependent on absolute sterility or lethality, should be
capable of experimental demonstration and measurement, and their
selective efficacy can be calculated from the frequencies with which
the alternative genes, or gene combinations, are found in nature.

They shouldthen form a measurable standard to which the efficacy
of mimetic selection, against which they must be balanced, can be
equated, and even its local variation examined. The importance of
such a direct determination need scarcely be emphasized; the
hindrances to free reproduction in these groups have appeared
hithertomerelyasanobstacleimpedingtheMendelian analysisofthe
polymorphic forms it is much to be hoped that, in view of the
;
application outlined above, their elucidation may, in future studies,
be made a principal object of research.

Whatever be the cause to which a factor owes its stability, any
species in which a stable factor occurs will be potentially dimorphic,
andpermanentlysounlessin changed conditions the stability canbe
upset. If, inthis condition, selection favours different modifications
of the two genotypes, it is clear that it may become adaptively
dimorphic by the cumulative selection of modifying factors, without
alteration of the single-factor mechanism by which the dimorphism
is maintained.

## Summary

The theoryofmimicryisofspecialinterestforthestudentofNatural

Selection, asaffording examples of the adaptive significance ofspeci-
fic and varietal differences, and by reason of the great disparity
betweentheviewsformed bythepioneers ofMendelism andthose of
selectionists.

The theory of Bates involves errors only of the senses of the
predator; it is subject to limitations imposed by the evolutionary
reactions ofbothpredator andmodel. The theoryofMiillerinvolves
errorsbothofthesensesandofthejudgement thepredator andboth
species of prey are all subject to evolutionary tendencies favourable
to Miillerian mimicry.

The statistical limitation of Miillerian mimicry put forward by
Marshallisbased oninsecurereasoning, andonexaminationisfound
to be whollyimaginary.

The observational bases for mimicry theory may be analysed into
five distinctive categories, two of which are characteristic ofNatural
Selection generally. Although full evidence is available only for a
very small minority of the cases suspected, the concurrence of
independent classes of observations puts the well-investigated cases
beyond possibility of doubt.

The evolution of distastefulness presents a special problem, which
may find its solution in the protection afforded by special distaste-
fulness among gregarious larvae to members of the same brood.

The tendency of Miillerian selection to cause the gradual and
mutual approach of different warning patterns supplies an explana-
tion of the difficulty felt by Punnett with respect to mimicry rings.

His further argument from the Mendelian character of polymorphic
mimicsthatthesemimicsaroseassuchbysinglesaltations, overlooks
theeffects ofotherfactorsin modifyingtheforms determined bythe
original mutations.

Mendelian polymorphism normally implies a stable gene-ratio in
thedeterminingfactor. Ifthemechanismofstabilityinvolves,as one
may suspect inPapilio polytes and Colias, anelement of sterility or
lethality balanced against an element of bionomic advantage, it
should be possible by analysing the mechanism of stability to
evaluate theintensity of selective advantage experienced in nature
by the favoured types.
