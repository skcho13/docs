### On Man

THE earlier discussions of Man in connexion with evolutionary

theorywere principally devoted to the establishment of two points.

First, that man, like the other animals, owed his origin to an evolu-
tionaryprocessgovernedbynaturallaw
;
andnext thatthosemental
andmoral
qualities
mostpeculiartomankindwereanalogous,intheir
nature, to the mental and moral qualities of animals ; and in their
modeofinheritance,tothecharactersofthehumanandanimalbody.

However necessarily the second conclusion may seem to follow from
the first on any unified view of organic nature, the fact that man's
traditional opinion of himself constitutedthe main difficultyto such
aunifiedviewcausedtheresearches,whichhaveledtothefinalaccept-
ance of Darwin's conclusion on this matter, to follow two paths,
distinctinsubject andmethod,whichmaybetypifiedbythelabours
ofHuxleyandofGaiton. The similarityofthehumantootheranimal
bodies must have been obvious from the earliest times. On the
crudestscientificclassification,hemustbeplacedasoneofaparticular
order of mammals. An enormous mass of investigation of the form,
development, and workings of his body, is foundto be consonant in
every detail with the view that he is an old world monkey, most
closely alliedto the tailless apes.

The minuteness with whichthis subject has been examined would
scarcely have been necessary, from the evolutionary standpoint, but
for the difficulties presented by the human mind. These difficulties
are of two kinds. The first flows from the great development of the
humanmind comparedwith the minds of other animals ofwhichwe
know enough to make any safe comparison. The second is that
we have an interior view or consciousness of the human mind, and
findinit qualities ofgreatconsequence or value to ourselves, which,
so long as we remain men, must appear to us immensely superior
to anything else in organic nature. Without this second factor,
I cannot think that the mere difference in degree of development
would have occasioned any popular difficulty in accepting the
scientific standpoint. Many animals show great development of
particular organs, without leading to any popular misapprehension
of their natural affinities. The trunk of an elephant is, regarded
merelyasastructuraldevelopment,atleastasremarkableasthehuman
brain,thoughithappens to be lessimportanttous.

Unfortunately for the general adoption of such an objective view
of things human, as is necessaryforthe scientific understanding of
human affairs, itis oftenfeltto be derogatoryto human nature, and
especially to such attributes as man most highly values as if I had
saidthatthehumanbrainwasnotmoreimportantthanthetrunkof
an elephant,orasifIhadsaidthatitoughtnottobemore importantto
us,ifonly wewereasrationalasweshouldbe . Thesestatementswould
beunnecessarilyprovocative: in addition they are scientificallyvoid.

And lestthere shouldbeanydoubtupon amatter, whichdoesnotin
the least concernscience, Imayaddthat,beingaman myself,Ihave
neverhadthe leastdoubt as totheimportance ofthehuman race, of
their mental and moral characteristics, and in particular of human
intellect, honour, love, generosity and saintliness, wherever these
precious qualities may be recognized. The supreme value which, I
feel, ought to be attached to these several aspects of humanexcel-
lence, appears to provide no good reason for asserting, as is some-
times done, with a petulant indignation not unmixed with spiritual
arrogance, that such alow matter as natural causation cannot be of
importance to these sublime things. Onthe contrary, it introduces
thestrongestmotiveforstrivingtoknow,asaccurately and
distinctly
as possible, in whatways natural causes have acted in their evolu-
tionary upbuilding, and do now act in making them more or less
abundant.

This reasonable, and I believe inevitable, consideration has been
toofrequentlyneglectedbywriters onbothsides ofthe controversy.

Some seem certainly to have thought that the replacement, by
rational, of sentimental or superstitious beliefs, on matters of fact,
could be paralleled, and as it seemed completed, by the establish-
ment of moral and aesthetic valuations upon an exclusively scien-
tific basis. Others, whose attitude can be explained, rather than
excused, by obscurantist opposition, would seem to have developed
a positivedislikeforthehigherqualities ofthe human consciousness,
at least for controversial purposes, and to delight in assimilating the
poetic and religious aspirations of mankind to whatever unedifying
proclivities may happen to have a similar physiological basis. It
seems to be not uncommon for medical students, who have learnt
something of the psychological effects of the sex hormones, to feel
that the poetic emotions, which the rest of mankind associate with
sexual love, are thereby discredited. And, although this may be
dismissed as an extreme and juvenile aberration, men are in general
somewhat reluctantto give up the early accepted dogma that what-
everis noblest in their nature must be due to causes, andeven arise
by processes, which in themselves possess the same value. Perhaps
the basis of this dogma, which seems to be, in itself, indefensible,
maybefoundinthearistocratic traditionbywhich menwerevalued
at least as highly for their ancestry as for their personal qualities.

Whatever may be its cause, the intellectual efforts made by a man
such as Wallace, to avoid ascribing the higher human faculties to
natural causation, should warn us of a source of error so powerful
thatitmightperhapshavepermanentlyincapacitated mankindfrom
furthering the development of what he values most.

Theconsciousandactivebeingisconcernedwithhimselfhabitually
as an original cause. If he considers the natural causes which have
brought himself into existence his perspective is inverted, and his
intuitions fail him. It is readily to be understood that differences in
behaviour, whether due to conscious deliberation or to impulsive
reaction, do in fact determine differences in the rates of death and
reproduction. Nor can we doubt that these differences in behaviour
flow from personal individuality in the constitution of the mind,
without which all men would act alike andthe concept of voluntary
action would be anillusion. It is true that this concept implies that
we take circumstances into consideration and act, or refrain from
acting, accordingly ; but also more emphatically that we weigh the
circumstances, and that others in like case might have acted differ-
ently. Apparent as is this aspect of voluntary action it is a remark-
able fact that many, who would find no difficulty in conceiving the
involuntary reactions of mankind to be modified by a selective
process,yetfinda difficultyinapplyingthesameargumenttomatters
involvingvoluntarychoice. Isuspectthereasontobethatvoluntary
choice is open to modification, apart from other circumstances, by
persuasion, and that the importance of the effects achieved by this
means sometimes prevent us from perceiving very striking contrasts
inthe ease withwhichpersuasionis effected.

The supreme inner arbiter of our choice in matters of right and
wrong we call our conscience. We do not regard our consciences as
opento outside persuasion, andfromthis point ofviewthey must be
regarded aswhollyinnate. We do, however,vshow someambiguityin
the extent to which we recognize their individuality. Emphatically
yourconscienceisnotmyconscience yet we aresometimes tempted
;
to be so uncharitable as to imply that, apart from hypocrisy or an
acquired callousness or blindness towards their own better nature,
others would assuredly comply with our own standards. From the
standpoint of selection it is a matter of indifference whether we
regard mankind as differing in their very consciences, or merely in
theirreactions to theirinward monitor. Since, however, each man is
aware only of his own conscience I shall be content, in what follows,
to take the former view.

Howeverobvious it may seem to some, it is certainly necessary to
insistuponthepointthatthesystematicpositionofmankindandthe
demonstrated inheritance of the mental and moral qualities do not
exhaust the evolutionary interest of the human species. On the
contrary, these are only preliminary inquiries designed to examine
whether man, and if so, whether man in all his aspects, falls within
thescopeofanaturalistictheoryofevolution. Theyarepreliminaries
to our interest in the evolutionary history and destiny of mankind,
asubjecttheinterestofwhichseems to have been very inadequately
explored. An animal which in its comparatively recent history has
undergoneprofoundchangesinitshabitat,diet, andhabitualposture,
should, for these reasons alone, beof sufficient interest tothe evolu-
tionist. If we add the development of a social organization un-
paralleled within its own class, the use of artificially constructed
implements, andameans ofexpressing and recording its experiences
and ideas, it is obvious that to the non-human observer mankind
would present a number of highly interesting evolutionary inquiries
and would raise questions not easily to be answered only by the use
of comparisons and analogies.

Mostmodern writerson genetics seem, withrespecttoman, to fall
into two opposite, butequallyunsatisfactory, attitudes. A minority
appeartofearthatthepurityoftheirsubject, as an abstractscience,
would be contaminated were it applied to the species to which they
themselvesbelong
;
andalthough,perhaps,interestedinthepractical
improvement of domesticatedanimals and plants, are careful, if any
pointinhuman geneticshastobementioned,todissociatethemselves
from any suggestion that it also may have practically important
consequences. A larger, and more enterprising school, fully imbued
with a sense of the universal applicability of genetic knowledge,
recognize in mankind a useful field for its exploitation. They are
more ready, and are perhaps better prepared, to appreciate the
similaritiesofhumaninheritancetothatofDrosophilaorMaize,than
they are to appreciate the special problems which the evolution of
man in society presents; and will sum up the human problem in a
cursory,
andeven
superficial,
chapterattheendofanelaborate, and
often admirable exposition of moderninheritancediscoveries. While
genetic knowledge is essential for the clarity it introduces into the
subject,thecausesoftheevolutionarychangesinprogress canonlybe
resolvedbyan appealtosociological, andevenhistoricalfacts. These
should at least be sufficiently available to reveal the more powerful
agencies at workinthemodificationofmankind.

### The decay of civilizations
The decay andfall of civilizations, including not onlythehistoric
examples of the Graeco-Roman and Islamic civilizations, but also
those of prehistoric times, which have been shown to have preceded
them, offerstothesociologist averyspecial anddefiniteproblem so
sharply indeed that its existence appears to chaUenge any claim we
daremaketo understandthenature andworkings ofhuman
society.

To be used properly the term civilization must be applied not
merely to those societies the institutions of which we see reason to
admire, but to designate the aggregate of all the social adaptations
appropriate to the permanent existence of a dense population. In
general form these adaptations have a universal character. In all
societies which we call civilized, the personalunderstandings, which
a man canform with a small circle of immediate acquaintances, are
supplemented by a vastly more numerous system of conventional
understandings, which establishes his customaryrelations, his rights
andhis obligations, withregardtothe entire society of which he is
amember. He is thus free to devote himself to productive labour
even of ahighlyspecialized character, with confidence that the pro-
duction of his primary necessities, the protection of his possessions
fromviolence, andeventhe satisfaction ofhis moralandintellectual
needs, willbeundertakenbythelaboursofothers, whomakeofsuch
tasks their special occupations. The specialization of occupations,
involving the customary acceptance of a conventional standard of
exchange,themaintenanceofpublicorder, andthenationalorganiza-
tionofmilitarypreparations, arethustheuniversalcharacteristicsof
the civilized in contradistinction to the uncivilized societies of man-
kind. It is a matter of experience, whichno onethinks ofdenying,
that such an organization doesinfactenableagiven areato support
a much largerpopulation, and that at a higher level of material and
intellectual well-being, than the uncivilized peoples who could
alternatively occupy the same territory.

Such a civilized society, once organized and established, how is it
possible to imagine that it should fail in competition with its un-
civilizedneighbours? Thelatteroccupytheirterritory more sparsely,
they lack moreover the organized central government which could
mobilize to advantage their scanty numbers. On the contrary, our
experience of uncivilized populations shows them to be divided by
hereditary enmities and petty jealousies, which should make their
union, evenupona question ofthe simplestnationalinterest, almost
an impossibility. Industrial organization gives to civilized peoples,
in antiquity as well as in our own times, the advantage of superior
weapons; while the habits of co-operative labour enable them to
adopt a more regular, co-ordinated, and effective system of military
tactics. Above all, the superior knowledge which a civilized people
can, anddoesindeed, continuallyaccumulate, shouldenable themto
actgenerallywithsuperiorinformation, with a surerforesight of the
consequences of their collective action, and with the capacity to
profit by experience, and to improve their methods if their first
attempts should prove to be unfortunate. Bearing in mind the
unquestionable advantages of superior knowledge, of co-ordinated
efforts and of industrial skill, should we not confidently anticipate,
if we were ignorant of the actual history of our planet, that the
historyofcivilizationwouldconsistofanunbrokenseriesoftriumphs
;
andthatonce thegermofan organized society hadmade itsappear-
ance,inBabylonia, perhaps, orinEgypt, itwouldbeonlyaquestion
of time for every country in the world to be in turn absorbed and
organized by the Babylonian, or Egyptian, civilization?
Theindicationswhichwe possessoftheearliercivilizations, aswell
as the plain narrative of the historic period, differ remarkably from
the rational anticipation deduced above. We see, indeed, a certain
tenuouscontinuityinmanyelementsoftraditionalcivilizationwhich
are handed on from one social group to another, as these in turn
become civilized. But this circumstance seldom even obscures the
contrasts between the social groups, involving differences between
theterritory,language,religion, and race, associatedwiththehighest
civilization at different epochs. These contrasts are obviously
associated,inthecaseofeachgreatchange,withtheviolentirruption
ofsomenew peopleofuncivilizedorigin. Theexperimentofbecoming
civilized has, in fact, been performed repeatedly, by peoples of very
different races, nearly always, perhaps, with some aid from the
traditionalideas of peoples previously civilized, but developing their
national and industrial organizations by their own progressive
powers; and in all cases without exception, if we set aside the in-
complete experiment of our own civilization, after a period of glory
anddominationaccompaniedbynotablecontributionstothesciences
and the arts, they have failed, not only to maintain their national
superiority, buteven toestablishapermanent mediocrityamong the
nations of the globe, and in many cases have left no other record of
theirexistencethanthatwhichweowetothelaboursofarchaeologists.

Before considering those causes which I propose to assign both to
the phenomenon in general, and to its more salient characteristics,
in the course of the succeeding chapters on Man, it is as well to give
someattentiontothepreliminaryquestion: Ofwhatsortshouldbean
explanation which we shouldregard as adequate? It is easyto find
among the peoples of antiquity institutions disagreeable enough to
our modern feelings, itis easy to criticize their educational ideas, or
the forms of government which they have successively adopted;
above allitiseasytofindfault with theirignoranceofeconomic law,
and to ascribe to their mistakes in this domain the same civil and
political misfortunes, which we anticipate equally from the parallel
errors of our political opponents ! Such arguments are not only
inconclusive from our ignorance of the laws of causation upon
which theyrely, they are also demonstrablyinsufficient to meet the
requirements of our special problem. For, in the first place, our
knowledge of the earlier stages of the history of great peoples shows
us customs no less repulsive, manners no less licentious, a neglect of
educationatleastequallypronounced,andignoranceofeconomiclaw
as absolute asanywhich canbeascribedtotheircivilizedsuccessors.

Inthe secondplace, moreover, in aperiodofnationaldecayitwould
be unreasonable to expect that any aspect of national life, political,
religious, intellectual, or economic, should remain in a healthy and
flourishingcondition, orthat the misfortunesofthe times willescape
the complaints of observant contemporaries. That the condition of
agriculture, for example, was unsatisfactory in the later Roman
empire, though a legitimate inference from the state of that society,
failstoconstituteinanyusefulsenseanexplanationofitsprogressive
decay. Peoples in the prime of their powers appear to find no diffi-
cultyinmakinggooduseofveryinferiornaturalresources, andadapt
their national organization with complete success to much more
violent changes than those which can be adduced to explain the
misfortunes ofthe laterstages oftheircivilization.

A physician observing a number of patients to sicken and die in
similar though notidentical conditions, and with similar though not
identical symptoms, would surely make aninitial error if he did not
seek for a single common cause of the disorder. The complexity of
the symptoms, and of the disturbances of the various organs of the
body, should not leadhim to assume that the original cause, or the
appropriate remedial measures, must be equally complex. Is this
not because the physician assumes that the workings of the body,
though immensely complex, are self-regulatory and capable of a
normal corrective response to all ordinary disturbances while only
;
a smallnumber of disturbances of an exceptional kindmeet withno
effectiveresponse andcause severe illness? Itis impossible to doubt
thatwehaveequallyarighttoexpectself-regulatorypowerinhuman
societies. Ifnot, weshouldbeledtopredictthatsuchsocietiesshould
break down underthe influence of any of the innumerable accidents
towhichtheyareexposed. Uncivilizedsocietiesofvariouskindshave
adapted themselves to every climate, from the Arctic, to the forests
and deserts of the Tropics. They share the territories of the most
savage or poisonous animals, and often long withstand without dis-
ruption the assaults of most implacable human enemies. Social
progress has not been arrested by the introduction of new weapons,
ofalcohol, orofopium,orevenofinfanticide yettheseintroductions
;
mighteach ofthem seemto threaten the existence oftherace. That
civilized men, possessed of more effective appliances, with access to
more knowledge, and organized for the most detailed co-operation,
shouldprovethemselvesincapableofeffectiveresponsetoanydistur-
bance of theirsocial organization, surely demands some veryspecial
explanation.

### Sociological views
A philosophical view ofhistory, which hasattainedtogreatpopu-
larityinseveral continental countries, regards the rise as well as the
fall of civilizations as butthe successive phases of a cycle of growth
and decay, which, itis supposed, repeatsitself, andwillrepeat itself
endlessly, throughout human history. So long as we aim at no more
than an effective generalized description of the phenomena there is
muchtobesaidforconsideringthephasesofriseanddevelopmentof
the great civilizations in conjunction with the phases of their decay
and collapse. Itis arealadvantagethattheparallelisms betweenthe
earlier phases of different cultures should be recognized, and that
theirrelations in time torecognizably parallellater phases should be
establishedas accuratelyas possible. Generalizeddescriptionshould,
however, neverbe regardedas an aim initself. Itis at best a means
towards apprehending the causal processes which have given rise to
the phenomena observed. Beyond a certain point it can only be
pursuedatthecostofomittingorignoringrealdiscrepanciesofdetail,
which, if the causes were understood, might be details of great con-
sequence. Alternatively, somewhat different states and events are
subsumed under generalized and abstract terms, which, the more
they are made comprehensive tendto possessthe less real and defin-
able content. Finally, any purely descriptive general picture of
events in time is in its nature fatalistic and allows no place for
intelligent and corrective intervention.

The early evolutionary speculations of the Greeks had this fatal-
isticandsterilecharacter,forthelackofanyclearlyunderstoodmode
of causation, which could bring about the modification of living
organisms. Itis characteristic ofthescientific attitude ofthe middle
of the nineteenth century that the evolutionary theories of earlier
generations excited little interest in the absence of a satisfactory
explanationcapable ofexpressingthe means ofmodificationinterms
of known causes. Even Darwin and Wallace, although Darwin at
leastwasinpossessionofmuchindirectevidence,didnotputforward
their evolutionary theories until each had satisfied himself that, in
the struggle for existence, natural selection did provide the efficient
cause. With a clear grasp of scientific principle, which is not always
sufficiently appreciated, it is evident that they felt that the mere
historical fact of descent with modification, however great its
popularinterest,couldnotusefully bediscussedpriortotheestablish-
mentofthemeansbywhichsuchmodificationmaybebroughtabout.

Once the nexus of detailed causation was established, evolution
becamenotmerelyHistory, butScience. Evidently, themore special
and peculiar is the case considered, the less can descriptive analogy
be relied upon, and the more essential is a knowledge ofthe laws of
causation.

In the descriptive study of the rise and decay of human civiliza-
tions the closest analogy which is found with any process capable of
scientific study is that with the growth and death of the individual
organism. In both, it may be said, we find, in regular sequence, a
period of developmental vigour and superfluous vitality with the
acquisition of new powers, a period of maturity with substantial
achievement, a period of stagnation in which the organism or the
society can do little more than hold its own, and a period of decay
followed sooner or later by dissolution. The moment we attempt,
however, to interpret this generalized description in terms of known
causes, the analogy is seen to be as false as it well could be. The
'youthful ' peoples whomweseeatthedawnoftheircivilizedhistory
have already behind them a social history far longer than the
civilizedperiod before them. Theyhavenot just been begottenfrom
elements secreted by previous civilizations, elements which might
be supposed to carry the hereditary determiners of the cycle of
changesto beenacted. The healthysociety may bosaidto grow and
to assimilate; it cannot be said to reproduce itself. And without
reproductionthereisnoterminusaquoforthesequenceofgrowthand
death. Societies are potentiallyimmortal, bearingwithinthemselves
thepowercontinuallytoreplaceeveryliving elementintheirstructure.

The phenomenon of senescence from which the whole analogy arose
is only observed in societies which have for some little time enjoyed
that closely co-operative structure which we call civilization.

If we set aside the purely descriptive point ofview, it is apparent
that, in associating the rise and growth of civilizations in a single
sequence with their decay and fall, the nature of the problem has
onlybeenobscured. Obviouslythephenomenaofdecadencecanonly
bepresentedafteracertainlevelofsuccesshasalreadybeenachieved.

But, whereas the decay of civilizations presents an abrupt and un-
expected problem, the advantagestobereaped from the progressive
adoption ofthose phases ofculture whichwe callcivilized are, to all,
obvious andfamiliar. Consequently, while a solution of the problem
presentedbydecadenceinterms ofthedetailedsociologicalreactions
to which itis due, woulddoubtless throw light on sociological causa-
tioningeneral, andconsequently onthe characteristics ofthe earlier
aswellasofthe later phases of civilized society, the merefactthat
a society, as it acquires the arts and organization of civilized life,
simultaneouslyexperiencesagreataccessionofprosperity and power,
is itself due to causes which are perfectly familiar and fully under-
stood. These advantages would be even further enhanced and pro-
longed, if, as it was formerly thought could be safely assumed, life
in the civilized condition, as in the barbaric state, favoured the sur-
vival and reproduction of those human types who could most
effectively promote the prosperity of their society, and who on the
otherhandwere mostapttemperamentallyto
appreciate
and
exploit
its advantages. The evolution of man from savagery, through bar-
barismtoafinalhighlycivilizedconditionmightthenberegarded, as
byHerbert Spencer, as forming a continuous and inevitable process
ofhumanadvancement. Inthelightofthishighlyrationaloptimism
the failure of high civilizations in the past appears as a single and
formidable problem.

### Insect communities

The onlyanimalsocietiesinwhichco-operationissufficientlyhighly

developed to justify comparison with civilized men are those of the
socialinsects. In these, specializationfortheperformanceofvarious
tasks such as defence, building, direct social services for the benefit
of the rising generation, and the collection or cultivation of food, is
sufficiently clearly developed; nevertheless, although social life has
appeared independently in several distinct groups, all alike present
the same initial difficulty to comparison with human societies, in
that, in addition to showing such specialization in behaviour or
capacity as is necessary for organized co-operation, all display an

while it cannot be denied that some small economic advantage
accompaniesthis, likeotherspecializationsforthe divisionoflabour,
yetthedangertothecommunityofentrusting its future existence to

Human communities show the same kind of genetic variation as
is shown by the species as a whole ; individuals are fitted for their
variousspecialtasks, partlybydirectanddeliberateselection, partly
byindirectselection viasocialclass, and partlyby specialeducation,
including in that term not only paid instruction in youth, but also
experience gained in practice. The different tissues of a metazoan
body, are, it seems, normally identical genetically, and owe the
differenceswhichtheyexhibitentirelytodifferencesintheinfluences
to which they are exposed from other developing tissues. The
different offspring of a single queen cannot be genetically identical,
forthefactorsinwhichtheir motheris heterozygous must segregate,
sothatineachsuchfactoroffspringofthetwokinds are producedin
equalnumbers. Such genetic variability, however, must be different
in each different society, and seems not to be utilized in producing
polymorphism among the workers, or even between the sterile and
the reproductive types. Although the subject is very obscure, the
predominantweightofopinionappearstofavourtheviewofWheeler
that the principle controlling influence is exercised through the
quantity of food supplied to the larvae during development. The
mechanismbywhichpolymorphismisproducedisthusverydifferent
from the simple Mendelian mechanism found in the polymorphic
butterflies, and one far more appropriate to the needs of social in-
sects. At thesame time it should be noticed, as with polymorphic
butterflies, that the particular mechanism employed to secure poly-
morphism throws no light whatever upon the adaptive and evolu-
tionarysignificanceofthepolymorphismitself. Themannerinwhich
developmental changes are modified by restricted nutrition is a
variableequallyexposedto selective actionasthemannerinwhicha
wing pattern is modified by a particular Mendelian mutant. The
selection in this case must act exclusively upon the reproductive
insects via the prosperity of the society from which they arise ; and
although the effect of such selection may be to modify only the
sterile workers, this presents no more difficulty than that a selection
acting exclusively upon the gametes of a sheep, via the observable
characteristics of the animal which bears them, should modify the
nature ofitswool.

Although real genetic differences must exist among the sterile
workers of the same society, these differences are without selective,
effects. The relative frequencies with which the different genotypes
appear among the offspring of a single queen must be presumed to
remain constant during her reproductive period, andthe selection of
males andfemalesforreproduction depends only on their individual
qualities, and the aggregate quality of the communities from which
they arise. On the contrary, the genotypic differences which char-
acterize the individuals of societies practising individualistic repro-
duction are exposed through their differential rates of death and
reproduction to an intra-communal selection capable of modifying
indefinitelythe genotypiccomposition of the body politic. Among a
groupof smallindependentcompetingtribestheeliminationoftribes
containinganundueproportionofthesociallyincompetent, andtheir
replacement by branches of the more successful tribes, may serve
materially to maintain the average standard of competence appro-
priate to that state of society. Evenin such astate of societyintra-
communal selection willundoubtedly be at work, and the larger the
socialgroup becomes the greater is the importance ofthe intra-com-
munalelement. Consequently,fromtheearliesttimesofwhichwehave
knowledge, the hereditary proclivities, which undoubtedlyform the
basisofman'sfitnessforsociallife, arefoundtobe supplementedby
aneconomicsystem,which,diverseasaretheopinionswhichdifferent
writers have formed about it, appears to the writer to be one of the
unconscious triumphs of early human organization.

The basis of the economic system consists in the free interchange
of goods or services between different individuals whenever such
interchangeappearstoboth partiestobeadvantageous. Itisessential
to thefreedom of such agreementsthatthe arbitrarycoercion of one
individualbyanothershall be prohibited, while, on the other hand,
the coercive enforcement of obligations freely undertaken shall be
supportedbythepublicpower. Itisequallyessentialthattheprivate
possessionofproperty,representing, asinthissystemitmustdo, the
accumulation of services already performed to other members of the
society, and the effective means of calling upon equivalent return
servicesinthefuture, shallberigorously protected. Inthe theory of
this system each individual is induced, by enlightened self-interest,
to exert himself actively in whatever ways may be serviceable to
others, and to discover by his ingenuity new ways or improved
methods of making himself valuable to the commonwealth. Such
individualsassucceedbestinperformingvaluableserviceswillreceive
the highest rewards, including, in an important degree, the power
to direct the services of others in whatever ways seem to them most
advantageous. Those, onthe contrary, who fail most completely to
perform socially advantageous actions have the least claim upon the
wealthandamenitiesofthecommunity. Intheorytheymayperishof
starvation, or may become indebted up to the amount of the entire
potential services of the remainder of their lives, or of the lives of
their children.

It need scarcely be said that this economic system has never
formed the exclusive basis of social co-operation in man. It has
atmostbeen partiallyestablishedincompromise withsocialinstincts
already in being, founded during the existence of less closely co-
operative societies. Nevertheless, it bears a sufficient resemblance,
both tothe theoryofrationalistic economists, and to the practice of
various ancient civilizations, to indicate that we have presented, in
anabstractandidealform, arealandeffectivefactorinhumansocial
organization. The biological importance of this factor lies in the
safeguard whichit appearstoprovide thatintra-communalselection

or parasitic types, at the expense of those who exert themselves

Onthecontrary,itseemstoinsure
that those who produce the bestgoods orprovide the most valuable

while those who, by capacity or disposition are unable to produce
goods equivalent to what they consume, shall be continually elimi-
nated. Nor is thisbeneficialselectionconfinedtoindividualsintheir
capacity of producers. In consumption and distribution an equally
beneficialselectionwouldseemtobeinprogress. Theindividualwho,
by reason of his imperfect instincts, is tempted to expend his re-
sourcesinways whichare nottohisbiologicaladvantage, theindivi-
dual who from prejudice favours a bad market, or who is tempera-

and, it would seem, at a selective, disadvantage. This selection of
the consumer provides in an important respect the theoretical com-
pletionoftheindividualistic economic system, foritsuppliesameans
bywhich the opportunities of gaining wealth by the provision of
illusory benefits, shall become ever narrower, until all substantial
sourcesofprofitareconfinedtotheprovisionofrealpublicbenefits
.

The
population producedby such a system should become ingenious and
energetic industrialists, shrewd and keen in the assessment of social
value, and with standards of well-being perfectly attuned to their
biological and reproductive interests. To complete the picture, at
the expense of anticipating a little a subsequent argument, our
economic Utopians must be endowed with consciences which recog-
nize thepossessionof wealth, atleast as a meanstoreproduction, as
the highest good, and its pursuit as the synthesis of all virtuous
endeavour. To them the wealthy man would enjoy not only the
rewards,butalsotheproofsofhisown
virtue,
andthatofhisforbears
;
he would be in some sort a saint, to co-operate in whose virtuous
proceedings would be a supreme felicity. Upon such men, no public
honour could be bestowed more noble than a direct cash payment,
and to purchase other honours for money would seem not so much
corruptas insane. Charity, in the sense of the uneconomic relief of
poverty,

If in practice man's sociological development had indeed taken

dividualistic habitinreproduction thathehadestablishedatype of

means open to them, to avoid the disastrous consequences of intra-

man himself can, overcome the further sociological difficulty which
has arisen can only be decided when that difficulty has been more
thoroughly examined. The important point for the present chapter
is that the difficulties that man has encountered and, at most,
partially overcome, have been evaded in all orders of social insects,
byforming the community from the offspring of a single individual.

Theprimaryevolutionaryprocess for us tonotice hereis the enor-
mous, though doubtless gradual, increase in individual fertility in
insects. As was remarked in ChapterII, the importance ofNatural
Selectioninmouldingfertility toitsoptimumvaluehasbeenobscured
bytheimportanceattached,byearlyevolutionarywriters, toa fhigh
rate of increase' as the primary driving force of Natural Selection
itself. When, on the contrary, we regard fertility as a secondary
phenomenon, determinedbyNaturalSelection,itbecomesimportant
to consider what circumstances influence the level of fertility which
is, inanyparticularcase,optimal. Inthis connexion Major Leonard
Darwinhaspointedoutthattheprincipalimportanceshouldbegiven
to the factor of parental care, including in thatterm all expenditure
in the form of nutriment, effort, or exposure to danger, incurred in
the production and nurture of the young. In organisms in which
that degree of parental expenditure, which yields the highest pro-
portionateprobabilityofsurvival,islarge comparedtotheresources
available, the optimalfertility willbe relatively low. Any circum-
stance which materially lightens the burden on the parent will
necessarily have an immediate effect in favouring survival ; it is
more important that it will usually lower the optimal expendi-
ture, and consequently tend to raise the level of fertility. Major
Darwin illustrates this principle by the example of the parasitic
cuckoos,whichhavefoundawaytorelievethemselvesofagreatpart
of the parental burden borne by other birds, and have, in fact,
acquired a considerably greater fecundity than their non-parasitic
allies. The social insects offer an even more striking example of the
same principle. As soon as the young adults of any incipient social
form took either to performing the preparatorylabour for reproduc-
tion,ortotendingtheyoung,beforetheyhadthemselvescommenced
to reproduce, the balance of selective advantage would have been
shiftedtowardsfavouringthe fertilityofthefoundress ofthe colony,
and favouring equally the development of the organs and instincts
of workers ratherthanof queens among herearlier, and possiblyless
well nourished, offspring. The enormous development of fertility
alongside extensive sterility in all groups of social insects shows
how powerful is the action of selection in modifying this particular
character. Inthefollowingchapter (IX)thehereditaryfactorswhich
influencefertilityinMan willbediscussed, anditwillbeseenthatthe
selective modification of these factors is as important, though in a
verydifferentway, to theevolutionofhuman astothatoftheinsect
societies.

### Summary

The earlier evolutionary work onMan was naturally directed to-

wards establishing thetwopreliminarypoints, (i) thatMan likeother
animals has arisen by an evolutionary process, (ii) that the mental
and moral qualities of Man are equally with the physical qualities
the result of natural causation. The difficulty felt by Man in re-
adjusting his traditional opinion about himself has required that
these two points should have been established with considerable
cogency.

A naturalistic view of Man provides no means of putting on
an objective basis those mental valuations, moral and aesthetic,.to
which Man attaches such high importance ; it cannot, therefore, be
used to throw doubt upon these valuations. The high human value
of the moralattributes does, however, investtheirnatural causation
with a specialimportance.

Among the problems presentedbythesocialevolution ofMan the
most conspicuous is that of the decay and ruin of all civilizations
previous to our own, in spite of their having had every reason to
anticipate continued success and advancement. The purely descrip-
tive treatment of the rise and fall of civilizations is inadequate
without an examination of the operative causestowhichchangesin
social structure are due.

Intheanimalkingdomtheonlysocietieswhichbearcomparisonwith
human civilization are those ofthe socialinsects, andthese all differ
fromhumansocietiesinthestrikingfeatureofreproductivespecializa-
tion. This has the effect of eliminating intra-communal selection as
an evolutionary process, so that the dangers to which society is
exposed from this source are special to Man. Human societies from
veryearlytimeshave adoptedaneconomic systemofindividualizing
propertywhichmighthavebeenexpectedto controlintra-communal
selection along socially advantageous lines. The logical effects to be
anticipated have, however, not been realized.

The specialization of reproduction in insect communities has been
possible owing to the efficacyofselectionin modifying fertility. The

### The great variability of human reproduction

THEexistenceofstatisticaldataforcivilizedman
mightsuggestthat
these should provide an opportunity for evaluating, in this species,
the probabilities of any individual leaving 0, 1, 2, ... offspring,
accordingtothe chances ofhislife as consideredin ChapterIV. The
3aseofman willbeshowntodifferfromthatofmostotherorganisms,
nthe high relative importance of differences in fertility andjn the
3omparatiza unimportance of the differences of mortality between
birth and the reproductive period. In view of these characteristics
3fmankind itwouldbe ofveryspecialinteresttobeabletoevaluate,
3ven approximately, the magnitude of the effects of the chance
^lamentincausingvariationinthenumbersofchildrenactuallyborn.

Two specialobstaclesmustbeencounteredinsuchan attempt, which
n the present state of our knowledge can be at best only partially
overcome. In the first place.the actual variation in the number of
children born, let us say,To a group of women at the end of their
^productive period, cannot, with the faintest show of reason, be
gcriEed^whoIlyto chance.. In this respectprobably mankind, in the
)ivilizedcondition, differsmateriallyfrom allotherorganismsexcept
tfie social insects. For unless the rates of reproductive selection in
bhcseotherorganismsaremateriallyhigherthanwehavehadreason
bo suppose, the chance factor must, as was seen in Chapter IV,.be
bhe dominant one in individual survival, contributing in fact nearly
bhewhole of the individualvariance. Inman, ontheotherhand,we
mustbepreparedto ascribetodifferencesinindividualtemperament
and disposition an amount of the variance almost as great as that
ascribable to chance, and therefore of an altogether different order
of magnitude from the reproductive selections to be anticipated in
other organisms.

If we cannot evaluate the chance component of the variance
by equating it to the total, the alternative method of evaluating
it a priori, as due to the successive occurrence of independent
events,isrendered,atbest,extremelyuncertainbythelong duration
and persistence of human purpose. The occurrences of successive
childrenare notindependent eventsin so farasthey are conditioned
by the married or unmarried state of their parents, although that
statemaybeheldtobeinfluenced,thoughinaveryminor degree, by
A
a genuinelyfortuitous element. complete statistical statement of
the birth-rates of the married and unmarried at each age, of the
frequencywithwhichtheunmarriedbecomemarried,andthemarried
become unmarried by widowhood or divorce, would still afford no
direct measure of the extent to which different members of an un-
differentiated group, would differ in their number of children. The
process of calculation which takes not only the successive births but
alsomarriages,asconditioningtheprobabilityofbirths,asa series of
eventsoccurringindependentlywiththeappropriatefrequencies, seems
to err as much in ascribing marriage wholly to chance, as does the
simpler
methodofcalculationinwhichtheeffectofmarriageisignored.

A.O.Powys (Biometrika,IV. 238)givesthenumberofchildrenborn
to 10,276 marriedwomen dyingaged 46 oroverinNcw^outhWales
from 1898-1902. Thenumberofchildrenvariesfrom to 30, andthe
number of women recorded at each value are given in Table 7. The
average numberofchildrenwas 6-19, andifthe datahad represented
women of equal natural fertility exposed throughout their lives to
equalriskofmaternitythevariancewould

TABLE 7.

A great part of the variance must certainly be ascribed tojage_at
^marriage. Yet the variance still exceeds the mean very strikingly if
data are chosen which should minimize this factor. A group of
2,322 wives married before 20 years of age, and living with their
husbands at the time of the Census (1901) 25-30 years later, are
distributed as in Table 8.

TABLE 8.

Frequencytotal2322
The mean number of childrenforthis group of women, for whom
the chosen conditions arc especially favourable to fertility, is 8-83^
but the variance is still as high as1243.

Fromtheseexamples, andindeedfromanyseriesof similardata,it
is evident, that while an exact evaluation of the chance factor in
reproduction is not possible, yet there clearly exist, both in the age
at marriage, and in fertility during marriage, causes ofvariation so
great as to be comparable with the chance factor itself.

The extraordinary variation in fertility in Man has been noticed
in a somewhat different manner by Dr. D. Heron, using material
provided by the deaths (30,285 males and 21,892 females) recorded
in the Commonwealth of Australia for 1912. Heron finds that half
of the total number of children come from families of 8 or more,
whicharesuppliedbyonlyone-ninthofthemenorone-seventhofthe
women of the previous generation. Itwouldbe an overstatement to
suggestjfchat the whole of this differential reproduction is^selectiye;

ioes it seem possible to deny that an equally substantial portion is
iue to a genuinedifferentialfertility, natural or artificial, among the
Various types which compose the human population.

### The mental and moral qualities determining reproduction

Whereas thepartplayed bychancein producing variationsinthe
rate of reproduction is elusive and difficult to evaluate, that part,
whichis dueto constitutional andtherefore he^ditaCT^fferences in
temperament, is manifestto all. Whenwe considerthe causes which
normallyleadtotheproductionofchildren,theoccasionsuponwhich
individualtemperament is liable to exert a decisive influence willbe
seen to be very numerous. A considerablepercentage gfpersons of
b0th^8^e^jaever marry: the age of marriage is very variable, and
wjth_wQin6n especially the effect of age is very great: according to
the Australianfigures of 1911 the maximum rate of reproductionfor
married women occurs at 18, and at 31 has fallen to half the maximum value. A bride of 30 may expect but 38 per cent, ofthe family

she would have borne had she married at 20, and by 35 the number
is further reduced by one-half, and is a little less than 19 per cent.

With men the potentiality of fatherhood is usually retained to a
considerable age, nevertheless the age at marriage is still very
influential, since the most frequent age for the brides increases
steadily with the age of the bridegroom. For bridegrooms of from
34 to 44 years of age, brides of the most frequent age are very
regularlytenyearsjuniortotheirmates. Usingtheageoftheirwives
as abasisforcalculation, men marryingat 40to 44 maybeexpected
to have only two-fifths of the number of children of men marrying
20 years earlier.

The choice between celibacy and marriage, and if marriage be
decided upon, between the precipitation and the postponement of
theunion, isinmodernsocietiesvery muchamatteroftemperament.

Some men are little charmed by female society, others of a more
sociable disposition seem for long unsuited to a permanent alliance :
in all normal men the primary impulses of sex appear to be suffi-
ciently developed, but in civilized circumstances the strength of this
impulse is not directly exerted towards the conjugal condition: in
many men it is overcome byprudence and self denial, in others it is
dissipated in unproductive channels. The various privileges and
obligations of marriage appeal very differently to different natures ;
patience, caution, and a strong sense of financialresponsibility often
postpone, or prevent the initiation of desirable matches: confident,
passionate, and impulsive natures marry in circumstances which
wouldawakeintheprudentthegravestmisgivings. The influence oi
theinnate dispositionin this matteris increasedin our owntimesbj
the absence of any strong social opinion which might regulate the
erring fancy of the individual, and by the conditions of urban life
which set no limit to the variety of acquaintance. Upon considera-
tion it would seem that while to the individual, fortuitous circum-
stances mayseem to be of much importance, theirinfluence iseasily
exaggerated even in determining the individual destiny. The man
who from an early disappointment condemns himself to celibacy,
is less the victim of misfortune than of his own temperament, as is
theunwaryyouth who becomesthelifelongvictim ofanunfortunate
entanglement. Ineachcasetemperamentlargely determineshowthe
chances of life are taken, and in the aggregate of sufficient numbers
the chance elementis wholly negligible.

The initiative inrespect of marriage is conventionally regarded as
confined to men, while the factors which determine celibacy or age
at marriage in the case of women are conditioned by the character
and frequency of the offers they receive. Even if this distinction
were absolute in practice, it would be difficult not to admit that
temperamental differences in young women do in fact exert the
predominantinfluenceupontheirrespectiveprobabilitiesofmarriage
within, say, thenextfiveyears. To thisprobability otherhereditary
characteristics will also contribute, in so far as they control beauty,
health or traits of character favoured by suitors. In point of fact,
however, the distinction between the sexes inthis matteris farfrom
absolute and the probability of marriage in either sex is much in-
fluencedbythecharacters,which,ona conventional basis, havebeen
ascribed to the other.

Besides these causes of varying fertility, which act through the
incidence of the social state of marriage or celibacy, there exist in
civilized and savage life, and have existed from the most ancient
times, a number of practices by which the increase of population is
artificially restricted. Infanticide, feticide or abortion, and the pre-
ventionofconception,haveallbeenorarenow beingpractisedamong
every considerable body of people: to these should be added such
practicesasprostitutiontheuseofwhichattainsthesame purposeby
competing withinstead of corrupting the conjugal condition.

The extent to whichinfanticide is and has been practised may be
appreciatedby aperusalofthemasterlysectionwhichWestermarck
devotes to the subject. Among uncivilized peoples, though not
universal, it is commonly customary, and frequently compulsory.

Though forbidden by Buddhism andTaoism itisfrequentinChina.

Among the pre-Islamic Arabs it seems to have been usual and
approved: it is repeatedly condemned in the Koran. It is not
mentioned in the Hebrew Scriptures, and may have been unknown
to the early Jews. In India where it was forbidden by the laws of
Manu, theRajputsare saidtohavebeen particularlyaddictedtothe
practice, for which, however, priestly absolution was obtained. In
Ancient Greece the practice of exposing healthy infants, though
hardly approved, was tolerated, except at Thebes where it was
a capitalcrime. InRome, thoughthedestructionofdeformedinfants
was enjoined, the murder, and the less decisive act of exposure, of
healthy infants was contrary to the prevailing moral standards.

Of those factors affecting the fertility of married persons in our
own civilization, by far the chief importance must be given to the
preventionofconception. Atthe presenttimethere canbeno doubt
of the wide prevalence of birth limitation among married couples in
EuropeandAmerica. Itisearnestlyurgedincertainrestrictedcircles,
thatonlybytheadoptionofthesemethodscanprivateindigence and
public scarcity be prevented, and their use is put forward not only
as a blessing but as a duty. Public opinion, however, so far as one
can gauge it upon a topic, which, however prominently discussed
is essentially private, appears to resemble that of Pliny respecting
feticide,thatitisavenialoffenceandonethatisfrequentlyexcusable.

' The great fertility of some women ', says Pliny, ' may require such
a licence '. It is important to observe that deliberate contraceptive
practices are confidently supposed to be the most important causes,
notonlyofthegeneraldeclineofthebirth-rateinrecentdecades,but
especially of the diminished fertility of the upper classes.

In the practice of, or abstention from, contraception, tempera-
mental differences, including the attitude towards sexual morality
generally, are particularly pronounced. This is evident, if only from
thevariousgroundsonwhichthispracticeis advocated. Itiscertain
that, to some, the freedom from individual liability to the natural
consequences of sexual intercourse is a most attractive feature, and
that a radical alteration of the accepted attitude towards sexual
morality, including the abandonment ofthe conventional abstinence
of the unmarried, would be welcomed. To others, again, who are
totallyaversefromsexualanarchy,agenuineappealis made through
the intensity of the parental instincts ; for the prospect of endowing
or educating the earlier children may be reasonably held to be
impaired by later arrivals. The sentimentthat the beneficent effects
ofparentalcompanionship alsogainsstrengthbybeingconcentrated
on a few, should perhaps be classed among the excuses, rather than
the reasons, forfamilylimitation. Yeteven the excuses are instruc-
tive from the enormous variability of the emotional response which
they evoke. The majority I suspect, even of those that practise it,
regard contraceptionwith some degree ofreluctance or aversion, but
accordingtothe strength ofthisfeeling maybeinducedto overcome
it by agreater orless intensity ofeconomic pressure. Others, again,
would certainly feel themselves disgraced if they were to allow
economic motives to curtail in any degree the natural fruit of their
marriage.

Ifweconsidertheimmense varietyofthetemperamentalreactions
ofmankindtowardthetwopredominantfactorsdeterminingfertility,
on the one hand marriage, and on the other the restricted or un-
restricted production of children by married couples, it will not be
surprising that, as hasbeen seen, an exceptionally great variability
ascribable to these two causes should appear in the statistics of
civilized peoples and thatthe genotypic differences in reproduction
;
outweigh any genotypic differences which it would be reasonable to
anticipate in mortality, the more especially since the incidence of
mortality among civilized peoples has been much diminished by the
advances which have been made in public and private hygiene. In
respect to mortalityitis necessary to note that only deaths prior to,
andinless degree during, thereproductiveperiod, haveanyselective
influence, and that these are already a minority of all deaths. The
diagram in Chapter II showing the reproductive value of women
accordingto age gives afairidea of theimportanceinthisrespect of
the death-rate at different ages. Even the highest death-rate in this
period, that in the first year of life, must be quite unimportant
compared with slight differences in reproduction; for the infantile
death-rate has been reduced in our country to about seven per cent,
ofthebirths, andevenadoublingofthisratewouldmake onlyabout
a third as much difference to survival as an increase in the family
from three children to four.

### Direct evidence of the inheritance offertility
Greatasthecontributionoffortuitouscircumstancestotheobserved
varianceinindividualreproductionundoubtedlyis, itisnonetheless
possible to obtain direct evidence of the importance of hereditary
causes, by comparing the number of children born to individuals
with the number born to their parents. As a biometrical variate the
numberofchildrenborntoanindividualispeculiarinseveralrespects.

It is, like the meristic variates, discontinuous and confined to the
positive whole numbers, while unlike most of these, the frequencies
beginabruptlyatzero. Moreover, wherereproductionisgovernedby
the civilinstitutionofmarriage, the variate will usually be the same
for a man and for his wife, and cannot be properly regarded as
distinctive ofeitherindividually. It is obvious too that where a con-
siderable fraction of the variance is contributed by chance causes,
the variance of any group of individuals will be inflated in com-
parison with the covariances between relatedgroups, with the result
that all correlations observable will be much diluted in comparison
withthosetobefoundbetweenmetricalcharacters. Rathernumerous
groups must therefore be studied if clear results are to be obtained.

From the data given by Pearson of the numbers of children born
to mothers and daughters, in a thousand cases extracted from the
BritishPeerage,theaverage numberofchildrenborntothedaughter
is found to increase according to the size of the family to which she
belongs, from 2-97fromfamiliesof 1,to6-44forfamiliesof 12ormore,

It would be important to ascertain to what extent, if at all, this

adopt this explanation, to the exclusion of organic inheritance, by

ideas, or in putting them into practice, in any degree by heritable
traits of character, and this is disproved by the obvious differences
observable in members of the same family. It is moreover far from
obvious, in considering the causes which might influence a young
girl's ideas on this subject, that the environment of a large family
would favour a higher degree of fertility than that of a small one.

The example of a mother must act both by suggestion and by
countersuggestion, andit wouldseem hazardous toassumethat
girls
are more strongly influenced, inpractice, by a consciousness of the
special advantages of their home environment, than by a conscious-
ness of its special disabilities.

However this may be, we possess in the relationship between the
fertility of granddaughters and that of their paternal grandmothers,
an unequivocal confirmation of the view that the relationship
observed between mother and daughter is essentially one of organic
inheritance. For a corresponding table shows that the regression of
the granddaughter's fertility onthat ofthe grandmother's is 0-1065,
almost exactly half of that found for the influence of the mother.

An effect due wholly to organic inheritance should approximately
be halved in each generation, apart from any strong tendency
towardshomogamy,andalthoughthegrandparentaleffectespecially,
thoughstatisticallysignificant,issubjecttosomewhat largesampling
errors, itscoincidencewith theexpectedvalueundoubtedlypointsto
organicinheritanceasresponsible, at least,forthegreater part of the
correlations observed.

Itisinstructivetoputthisagreementinanotherway. Inthetable
between mother and daughter, the covariance1 between the two
fertilities is 20-9 per cent, of the variance observed in the fertility of
thedaughters. Incharactersalmostwhollydeterminedbyinheritance,
the covariance should be almost half of the variance, and we may
thus make the estimate that 41-8 per cent, of the observed variance
in fertility is ascribable to heritable causes. In Chapter II it was
pointedoutthatagoodestimateofthegeneticelementinthevariance
of any character could be obtained by dividing the square of the
correlation between parent and child, by the correlation between
grandparent and grandchild. In the present instance this gives us
(0-2096)2-f-0-1123 or 39-1 per cent. Both methods of calculation
therefore agree in ascribing about 40 per cent, of the observed
variancetoheritable causes, andthis estimate, whenweconsiderthe
enormouspredominanceoftherandomelementinindividualsurvival
obtained in the discussion in Chapter IV, shows that the heritable
factors influencing human fertility must exert a selective effect of
quite exceptional magnitude.

We
may express the selective intensities thus indicated in the
units we have used hitherto to express differences in the Malthusian
parameters, namely per cent, per generation, by recognizing that
thegeneticvariancearrivedatintheprecedingparagraphisinactual
magnitude 3-042units, correspondingtoastandarddeviation, dueto
hereditarycausesonly,of 1-745childrenperfamily. Sincetheaverage
number of children born to the daughters is 3-923, individuals or
stocks differing from the average by no more than the standard
deviation, in opposite directions, will have families in the ratio
5-668 : 2-178. If the generations are of equal length, we may obtain
theselectiveadvantageofthemorefertileoverthelessfertilegroups,
byfindingthedifferencebetweenthenaturallogarithms ofthesetwo
numbers. This difference is 0-9564, indicating that the selective
advantage produced by variations (of by no means exceptional
magnitude) in innate fertility, amounts to over 95 per cent, in each
generation. In this form the statement of the intensity of selection
is comparable tothe selection of the order of one per cent, which it
has hitherto been found convenient to consider in exemplifying the
numerical effects of selections of determinate intensity.

### The evolution of the conscience respecting voluntary reproduction

The calculations of the last section indicate that among our con-
temporaries, at least, differences in heritable disposition play so
large a part in the determination of fertility, that somewhat large
modificationsoftemperamentmustbebroughtaboutbyreproductive
selection within a span of ten generations, that is within a relatively
short historical period. We have seen that by no means extreme
genotypes have rates of reproduction in a ratio higher than 2 to 1,
andifforsimplicity we imagineapopulationconsistingoftwo
strains,
which, having equal mortality, differ only to this extent in fertility,
it is easy to see that the numbers of one type relative to that of the
other will, in ten generations, be increased over a thousandfold. To
put the matter in another light, if at the beginning of the period the
population consisted of 97per cent, of the less fertile and 3 per cent,
of the more fertile strain, in 5 generations the 2 strains are brought
to an equality, and in 5 more their situations are reversed, so that
the less fertile strain is represented by 3 and the more fertile by
97 percent, ofthe population. Civilizedman, infact, judging bythe
fertility statistics of our own time, is apparently subjected to a
selective process of an intensity approaching a hundredfold the
intensities we can expect to find among wild animals, with the
possible exception of groups which have suffered a recent and
profound change intheirenvironment. We maytherefore anticipate
that a correspondingly rapid evolution has taken place within
historical times in the appropriate mental attributes.

Asiswellknown,thepracticeofinfanticideissomewhatwidespread
among uncivilized peoples. If we consider the perils of savage life,
and the extreme hardships to which uncivilized peoples are from
timeto time exposed, it would, Ibelieve, be amistake toregardthis
practice as altogether a maladaptation. Wherever the mortality in
infancy and childhood is extremely high, the reproductive value, in
thesenseofChapterII,ofanew-borninfant,mustbesmallcompared
to that of a young and fertile woman. In times of famine, or of
urgently enforcedmigration, an attempt to spare thelife ofthe child
would not only be often unsuccessful, but would certainly endanger
the more valuable life ofits mother. The act of infanticide, however
offensive to civilized feelings, has, in these circumstances, a certain
natural propriety, and it is not surprising that it should often be
regarded as amoral action andbe, to some extent, compulsory. The
motive may be regarded as economic but since among peoples with
;
whom the accumulation ofproperty is ataminimum, foresight as to
future resources is only felt under urgent stress, their motives can
scarcely be called prudential. Among settled peoples, on the con-
trary, prudence and the accumulation of property begin to play an
essential role, while the immediate effect of increasing prosperity,
by diminishing the selective importance of the death-rate, is to
enhancethatoftherateofreproduction. Itisnotsurprisingtherefore
that the religions of all civilized peoples, without exception, should
expressly condemn infanticide, although in severalcases, such as the
peoples of Northern Europe and the pre-Islamic Arabs, we know it
to have been the practice of their barbarous ancestors.

It is evident that the natural instincts of the father and mother
must offer some resistance to the practice of infanticide, even when
it is performed under the pressure of need. Moreover, we cannot
doubt that savages, like civilized people, differ among themselves in
their degree of callousness or sensibility. The feeling ofaversion and
repugnancetothecruelactmustbemore stronglydevelopedinsome
parentsthaninothers, andsinceinfanticideisalwaystosomeextent
atthediscretionofthe parents,itcannotbedoubted that the former
allow a larger number of offspring to live. In this way there is
a natural tendency, wherever infanticide is practised without the
pressureoftheseveresthardship,tostrengthenthe feelingsoftender-
ness and compassion towards the newly born child, by the natural
eliminationofthosewhoarethemost willingtomurdertheiroffspring,
for the sake of an easier or a freer life.

Amongstwhollysavagepeoples, althoughinfanticideisnotusually
regarded aswrong, itis probablynotpractised more frequentlythan
is on the whole racially advantageous. If however, in the course of
time, apeople, with feelings in this matterappropriate to the condi-
tion of extreme savagery, came to be placed in conditions in which
the accumulation of property is not only possible, but is the natural
aimofthemoreambitious, thetemptationtoinfanticide willbemore
uniformly insistent, and the corresponding selection of the moral
instinctswhichresistthistemptation, will be correspondingly severe.

Ifwe accepttheviewthatalllongcivilizedpeopleshavebeenpurged
oftheir more callous or murderous elements by passing through this
period of severe selection, we shall be in a position to realize why
it is that the consciences of civilized peoples, as expressed in their
religiousteaching,shouldsounhesitatingly condemninfanticide.

An interestingexample ofsuch atransitional periodis supplied by
the Arabs. The extreme hardship of the life of the desert Bedouin
must have presented many occasions in which infanticide was,
not merely economically, but biologically advantageous. Property
existed, butwas principallytribal, andtribalfeelingisevident inthe
restrictionofinfanticide tofemalechildren. Inthepre-Islamicperiod
wehearofreluctantparentsbeing urgedto killtheirbabydaughters
forthesake oftheirtribe. Inthelittletrading centresthe conditions
of life were doubtless much ameliorated, and the possession of
property was certainly largely individualized, though moral opinion
wasdoubtlessdominatedbytheBedouintradition. TheKoraish,the
tribe of Muhammad, seems to have been in possession of Mecca for
aboutfivegenerationsbeforehisbirth. Atthattimeitisevidentthat
the public conscience was beginning to rebel against the usages of
their ancestors, from the importance which his little band of prose-
lytes attached to abstaining from infanticide. It isabjured inoneof
the few clauses of the 'First Homage', and is repeatedly forbidden
inthe Koran. One ofthe first acts ofMuhammad, afterhis conquest
of Mecca, was to obtain an oath of abstinence from infanticide from
theMeccanwomen. Toavoidthemisapprehensionthatthisdoctrine
was connected with the military ambitions of the Moslem state, it
should be noted that the 'First Homage' was taken before Muham-
mad's flight from Mecca, at a time when the idea of upholding their
faith by force of arms was entirely remote from the minds of the
faithful.

If it be conceded that the selective effect of infanticide has been
graduallytoextinguishthosehereditarytypesoftemperamentwhich
are least unwilling to conform to this savage custom, a similar selec-
tive effect is to be expected from the equivalent act of feticide or
abortion, wheneverfromprudentialmotivesthispracticehasbecome
sufficiently common. The history of the evolution of moral opinion
in ancientGreeceandRome, during a period when feticide was very
widely practised, isthereforeofconsiderable interest. It is fortunate
thatanexaminationofthehistoricalevidencerelevanttothetheories
underdiscussiondoesnotrequireadetailedknowledgeofthepractice
of peoples at different epochs, but of the prevailing moral opinion as
to what is right and what is reprehensible. An investigation into
practice
wouldbeamatterofthegreatestdifficulty,asisevidentfrom
ourignorance of the current practices of our own time. The practice
of different individuals at any one time is, moreover, certainly far
more variable than their moral opinions, which are usually held in
common to a rather remarkable degree. The majority of those who
dowhatisthoughttobe wrongcertainly dosowithoutdepartingfar,
in their moral opinions, from the rest of the society to which they
belong. We can seldom indeed find distinct differences of moral
opinion, even between the protagonists in religious controversy. If,
therefore, we find pronouncements upon social practices in the
writings of moralphilosophersofhighreputeintheirown generation,
we are on very safe groundininferring thattheirexpressed opinions
onthesesubjects werenotshockingtoanyconsiderablebodyoftheir
contemporaries, but, onthe contrary, were nicelydesignedtoexpress
the common ground of thoughtful and high-minded opinion in their
own time.

In the fourth and fifth centuries B.C. no opprobiumseemstohave
been attached to the practice of feticide. We find high-minded men
ofthegreatest moralweightcommendingitsutility. Platoadvocates
it principally for eugenic, Aristotle for economic motives, much as
high-minded men of our own day may be found to advocate more
modern methods of birth limitation. A few centuries later a some-
what changed outlook is unmistakable. Polybius, in whose time, in
the second century B.C., the increase of the custom had led to an
evident depopulation, regards this as a political evil, and evidently
feltthattherich, atleast, shouldbeblamedasunpatriotic. 'Forthis
evil grew upon us rapidly, and without attracting attention, by our
men becoming perverted to a passion for show and money and the
pleasures of an idle life, and accordingly either not marrying at all,
or, if they did marry, refusing to rear the children that were born,
or at most one or two out of anumber, for the sake of leaving them
wellofforbringing themupinextravagantluxury.' Hebelievesthat
this should be changed, 'by the men themselves if possible changing
theirobjects of ambition ; or, ifthatcannot be done, bypassinglaws
forthepreservationofinfants'. InthefirstcenturyA.D. Pliny, whom
we have already quoted, is almost apologetic, but evidently broad-
minded. Seneca is more severe. Writing in praise of his mother
Helvia he specially mentions her virtue in never having committed
feticide,
anactwhichheevidentlyreckonsamongthefolliesandvices
of the fashionable world. We may see by these instances, and by
manyotherlessdirectindications, thataprofoundchangehadtaken
place in the public conscience of the Roman Empire before its con-
version to Christianity. A few centuries later, what had seemed
patriotic and high-minded to Plato and Aristotle, a venial offence
and afashionable folly to Pliny and Seneca, was anathematized as a
damnable sin by the Christian fathers, such as Tertulliaii, and was
made a capitaloffence in the laws of Valentinian.

Sincethe changeinmoralopinionwithrespecttofeticide, together
with associated changes in sexual morality, took place over a period
during which the ancient world experienced the religious revolution
ofconversiontoChristianity, andsincetheseconcurrentchangeswere
ultimately connected causally, it is important to avoid the mis-
apprehension that the change in moral feeling, with which we are
concerned, was derived as a consequence from the acceptance of
Christian doctrine. It would, I believe, be afundamental mistake to
imaginethatthemoralattitude ofanyreligiouscommunityisto any
important extent deduciblefrom theintellectual conceptions of their
theology (however much preachers make it their business so to
deduce
it),
andstillmore to supposethatofficialdoctrine isnotitself
largely moulded by the state of the popular conscience. The facts
available to guide us in the present case are:
(i) The progressive change of moral opinion among pagan writers
from Plato to the jurist Julius Paulus, who, about the beginning of
thethirdcenturyA.D.,statedtheopinionthattheexposureofchildren
was morally,thoughnot legally,equivalent to murder, and expressed
strong disapproval of the practice of feticide. The opinion of these
writers, who either knew nothing of Christianity, or rejected its
doctrine, cannot easily be ascribed to the state of Christian feeling
upon the subject.

(ii) Our earliest authentic source of Christian doctrine, the story
as toldin the Gospels, teaches an attitude ofgentleness, forbearance
andself-sacrificewhichhaseversince beenregarded asideallyChris-
tian. It contains, however, no condemnation offeticide andcannot
;
even be regarded as the source of the theological doctrine of the
damnation of unbaptized infants, even if born dead, which un-
doubtedlyatalaterdateexertedanimportantinfluenceincrystalliz-
ing Christian opinion upon this subject. It cannot easily be argued
that, while not specifically condemning feticide, the gentle and
humane character of the Gospel teaching in reality determinedthe
later attitude of the church, for there is nothing gentle or humane
in the doctrine we have quoted, and the early Christian legislation
against sexual offencescertainly seemstoerron the side of excessive
ferocity. On a statute of Constantine Gibbon remarks :
The successful ravisher was punished with death; and as if simple
death wereinadequate to the enormity of his guilt he was either burnt
alive, ortorninpieces bywildbeastsintheamphitheatre. The virgin's
declaration that she had been carried away with her own consent,
instead of saving her lover, exposed her to share his fate. The slaves,
whether male or female, who were convicted of having been accessory
to the rape or seduction, were burnt alive or put to death by the
ingenious torture of pouring down their throats a quantity of melted
lead.

We can understand the temper of such legislation as the work of
men filledwith a temperamental fear and loathing of sexual licence,
working in a frenzy of fanatical enthusiasm we cannot explain it
;
as the work of broad-minded and tolerant men convinced by the
Gospel story of the divinity of Jesus.

(iii) That a stricter sexual morality, including a more vehement
condemnation of feticide, did in fact characterize Christian as
opposed to Pagan ethics, when these are contrasted contemporane-
ously, must be ascribed in large part to the direct appeal made by
Christianitytothesanctionoftheindividualconscience, whichmade
it the more responsive to popular feeling, even when latent and un-
expressed. This effect was certainly enhanced by the solicitude of
the early Church for persons of the meanest occupational status,
since, as will be shown more fullyin Chapter XI, the evolutionary
effects of variationsinreproduction are greatestin the lowest social
class. In these respects the influence oftherise of Christianity upon
the change in moral opinion was intimate and direct; it would be
beyondthescopeofoursubjecttoconsiderthisassociationasafactor
in determining the triumph of Christianity in the Roman world.

### Analogies of animal instinct and immunity to disease
To a remote spectator the evolution which the human instinctsof
reproduction have undergone during civilized periods would seem
scarcely more remarkable in kind than the analogous modifications
which the reproductive instincts of other animals have undoubtedly
experienced in their evolutionary development. The principal con-
trastwould probably seemtolieinthegreatintensityoftheselective
process inMan, andthe correspondinglyrapidevolutionaryprogress,
in spite of the great length of the human generation. The moral
qualities are so important to ourselves, and appear to possess so
absolute asanction, thatitisnoteasyatonce totake upthisremote
view-point yetanysympatheticconsiderationofthecontingenciesof
;
reproduction among the higher animals must convince us that their
moral nature also must have been in many cases modified by a
strictly analogous form of selection. The astonishing courage shown
by many ordinarily timid species of mammals and birds in the
defence of their young, and even the abstention of carnivorous
mothers from infanticide, are cases in which we can at least be sure
that the emotional response to a situation connected with reproduc-
tion has been modified in a manner analogous to the modifications
ofthe moralemotionsfoundnecessaryinmanto overcome the temp-
tation to the specific vices to which he is exposed.

of the view that, if they could be tested under equal conditions in
thesame environment,the most anciently civilizedpeoples,orrather
thosegroupsinwhosecollective ancestryexposureto civilizedcondi-
tions has been greatest, are the most prolific, while those most
recentlycivilizedareleastabletomaintaintheirnumbersinacivilized
community. For example, inthe maternity statistics of the State of
Rhode Island as reported by Dr. Hoffmann we have the proportion
ofwomen married at the time of the Census (1905) who atthat time
were still childless, stated according to religious denominations,
Protestant, Catholic, or Jew, and for American born and Foreign
born women respectively. The percentages given are :
TABLE 10.

American Foreign

Protestant . . 30-7 19-4
Catholic . . 24-2 16-9
Jewish . . . 18-9 11-4
The contrast between the American born and the Foreign born is
apparently one of social class comparable to the occupational dif-
ferencestobeconsideredmore fullyinthenextchapter. The
religious
differences might conceivably be ascribed to the direct effect of
religious doctrine as to the practice of contraception, which is con-
demnedbythereligious headsofboththe Catholic and of the Jewish
communities. It seems more probable that the differences are racial
in origin, and on this view it is at least interesting that the racial
stock of Protestant peoples should be relatively recently civilized,
while that of the Jews has been largely exposed to the influence of
civilization from times prior even to the classical civilization of the
Mediterranean area.

The bare fact of a people having become gradually averse to a
specific action, such as feticide, owing to its effect upon the propor-
tionatesurvivalofdifferentindividualsinthe ancestryofsubsequent
generations, throws very little light upon the mental processes by
which this feeling of aversion is brought about. As a cause of such
changesNaturalSelectionisentirelyindifferent to the means, solong
astherequiredendofeffectivereproductionisachieved. TheChinese
belief respecting infanticide, that the ghosts of the murdered babies
bring misfortune, indicates a method of modifying the reproductive
instinctsbythepreferentialsurvivalofthemorecredulousand
super-
stitiously fearful. It may well be considered that the source of such
abeliefistobefoundinaninnatetendencytoexperience a feelingof
guilt on committing infanticide ; but when such a belief has grown
up, and has become widely accepted, its existence will undoubtedly
modify the incidence of selection in the particular mental qualities
which are favoured. Although the progressive strengthening of the
reproductiveinstincts,which may be regarded as the principal effect
ofreproductiveselection,willbe steadilypursued,avarietyofpsycho-
logical modifications, together with sociological changes consequent
uponthese, mayallbe, indifferentcircumstances, effective meansto
thatend. It is convenient to regard asthe primaryeffectofselection
directed against a conscious and voluntary action, the development
of moral aversion towards that action, while other mental attributes
which produce the same effect, through the pursuit of illusory ends,
constituteakindofmimicryoftheappropriatemorality. Which type
of mentalattribute will turn out in practice to be the most effective,
and in consequence be subject to the most rapid modification, must
dependinpart ontheextenttowhichknowledgeofnaturalcausation
is diffused among the people in question.

A consideration which is relevant to the conscious choice of the
parents in reproduction, equally with their moral attitude towards
the methods of family limitation available, is the motive for which
that limitation is desired. Parents in whom economic ambition is
strong, will, in like circumstances, be more inclined to limit their
families than those in whom it is weak. Consequently a progressive
weakening of the economic ambition, or at least in the average
intensity with which this motive is felt among the great body of
citizens, is to be expected as a concomitant to the strengthening of
the moral aversion towards family limitation. The attitude of men
and women towards their economic welfare cannot, however, be
ordinarily reduced by this cause to indifference, for in countries in
which the poorest class are frequently decimated by famine, it is
apparent that a stage will be reached at which what is gained in the
birth-rate is lost inthe death-rate and even where the extremes of
;
distress are ordinarily avoided, some loss of civil liberty, and of the
opportunities for reproduction, has been the common effect of indi-
gence. Moreover the rational pursuit of economic advantage must,
even in the most civilized countries, frequently place the individual
inapositionfavourabletonormalreproduction. Itwould,apparently,
in most societies, be as disastrous to the biological prospects of the
individual to lack entirely the acquisitive instincts as to lack the
primary impulses of sex, notwithstanding that the abuse of either
passion must meet with counter-selection. The moral attitude of
civilized peoples towards money, as towards sex, must be therefore
the productofmuchmorecomplicatedevolutionaryforcesthanishis
attitude towards infanticide orfeticide, as might perhaps be inferred
from the hypocrisy andfanaticism, the passions and the passionate
inhibitions,foundamonglong-civilizedpeoples onboth
subjects.

### Summary

The number of children actually born to different individuals in

civilizedsocietiesis, asinotherorganisms,largelyinfluencedbychance.

Whereas in most wild organisms the contribution of other causes to
the actual variation is probably so small that it could not easily be
detected, the total variance in the number of offspring produced in
civilized man issogreatthataconsiderablefractionmustbeascribed
to causes other than chance.

Temperamental qualities exert a great influence in determining
celibacy, orage atmarriage, bothinmenandwomen. They are, and
throughout human history generally have been, at least equally
importantin conditioning the use or abstinence from the use of arti-
ficial methods of family limitation.

The number of children born to women is significantly correlated

especially of the moral temperament. The intensity of selection by
differences of fertility, due to innate causes of the order found, is
relatively enormous in comparison to selective intensities to be
expected in nature. In spite of the late maturity of man, it is suffi-
cienttoproduceconsiderableevolutionarychangesinrelativelyshort
historical periods.

The customof infanticide in the towns of pre-Islamic Arabia was
accompaniedby a change in moral outlook which finallyforbade the
custom. The widespread use of exposure and feticide in the earlier
ages ofthe Graeco-Roman civilizationwas accompaniedbyagradual
and persistent change of opinion in regard to these practices, until
they finally became capital crimes. The influence of Christianteach-
ingupontheabolitionoftheseviewswasverygreat, butthisinfluence
sprangratherfrom the consciences ofthe people thanfrom dogmatic
doctrine.

Races may be regarded as becoming immune to race-destroying
vicesin a manner analogousto the acquirement ofimmunity against
disease by means of selective mortality. There is some evidence in
modern statistics that those races are most immune, evento modern
methods of birth limitation, which have had the longest social
experience of civilized conditions.

The evidences examined leave little room for doubt that the most
powerful selective agency in civilized man is that acting upon the
mental and moral qualities by way of the birth-rate, and that this
agencyis atworkwith an intensity which cannot easily be paralleled
in other species.

### Economic and biological aspects of class distinctions

FOBthe biologicalstudyof mankindthe institution of social class
has a double importance. Merely from the economic standpoint the
different occupations are graded in the rewards which they secure to
their professors, and, it is to be presumed, in the social value of the
servicesperformed. From thispointofview, the social class which a
family occupies may be regarded as the margin of prosperity which
separates it from destitution, or at least from a level of bare sub-
sistence ; so that a comparative failure in one occupation is free, at
the expense of some loss of social class, to find some humbler mode
oflivinginwhichhistalentsaresufficienttowinthenecessarysupport
for himself and his family. The elasticity afforded by the range of
occupations,andbythedifferencesintherewardswhichtheyprocure,
rnaythus beregarded as mitigatingthe severity ofthe consequences
which failure entails upon solitary organisms, by leaving for the
majority of the population a certain margin of safety from absolute
destitution.

An aspectofsocialclassofmoredirect biologicalimportanceliesin
the profound influence which it exerts upon the intermarriage of
different families. In several instances the importance of avoiding
classintermarriagehasbeensostronglyfeltthatsuchmarriageshave
been opposed by definite legal penalties, with the consequentforma-
tionofclosed, moreorlessaristocratic,castes
.

Thishasbeen
especially
the case where racial differences have been involved. Without any
such legal provision, however, prevailing opinion, mutual interest,
andthe opportunities for social intercourse,have proved themselves
sufficient, in all civilized societies, to lay on the great majority of
marriages the restriction that the parties shall be of approximately
equal socialclass. Inthis statementsocialclass should, ofcourse, be
taken to comprehend, not merely income or wealth, but also the
prestigeattachingtooccupation, personaltalents, and familyassocia-
tions. Its meaning is thus somewhat different from, though closely
correlated with,the purely economic use of theterm. Butthefactor
of intermarriage is so important in its social and biological conse-
quencesthatit willbe bestto usetheterm'socialclass' solely inthis
sense and to lay down that the social class of an individual or his
family shallbe denned bythe aggregate of persons orfamilies, inter-
marriage with whom will encounter no social obstacles.

Byreasonoftheinfluenceofclassonmate selection, distinctions of
socialclassaredistinctionsofrelativelypermanentbiologicalentities,
notindeed strictlyinsulated,butinfluencingoneanotherbyaconstant
diffusionofpersons who passfromclasstoclass. Thismutualdiffusion
shouldbedistinguished fromthegreattideofsocialpromotion,which,
as will beseenmore clearly, is now everywhereinprogress, andupon
which the mutual influence by diffusion may be regarded as super-
imposed. Thesetwosocialmovements are, ofcourse, confusedinthe
historyofeach severalindividual, but their causes and consequences
must clearly be distinguished. The relativelypermanentcharacterof
the social classes gives a special importance to the differences which
existintheirvitalstatistics,for,toproduceanevolutionarychangeit
is necessary that groups contrasted, for example, in their rates of
reproduction, should also be differentiated genetically; and if this

like differences in reproduction should continue generation after

That a puzzling discrepancy existed between the birth-rate of
certain highly placed families, and those of the general population,
seems to have been suspected during a great part of the nineteenth
century butneitherthemagnitudenorthegeographicalextent, nor,
;
indeed, the sociological nature of the phenomenon seems to have
been appreciated until quite recent times. The theory, of unknown
origin, that the 'inbreeding' supposed tobe practised by exclusive
aristocracies,wasacauseofsterility(andofothersignsofdegeneracy)
was doubtless framed under the impression that wealthy plebeian
families were as fertile as the rest of the community. Herbert
Spencer's theory of an inherent opposition of 'individuation' and
*genesis' would seem to suggest that he recognized some failure of
reproduction as characteristic of the brain-workers. One of the
most important points established by the modern data is that the
deficiencyinprocreationisnotspeciallycharacteristicoftitledfamilies,
or of the higher intellects, but is a graded quality extending by a
regular declivity from the topto the bottom ofthe social scale.

### Defects of current data
Before considering some of the moreimportant researches in this
fielditisnecessarytopointoutthat,althoughthegeneralcharacterof
the facts may be said to be established, in most western countries
with certainty, yetthe actual quantitative data availablearefarless
satisfactory than they might easily be made, and this for two prin-
cipalreasons. Inthefirstplace,theyaremuchoutofdate, and relate,
in some of the most important instances, to the rate at which births
were occurring in different classes as much as thirty-five years ago
;
whileastowhatis now
occurring
wecanonlyconjecturefromthepast
courseofevents. ThebestdataforEnglandandScotlandasawhole,
forexample,arestillthosewhichwereobtainedinthecensusof 191
1,
from the completed families of persons enumerated in that census.

Many ofthechildrenuponwhich these comparisonsrest were, there-
fore, born quite as early as 1890 and represent the behaviour rather
ofthelastthanofthepresentgenerationofparents. Suchaninterval
of time may be of great importance in bringing to pass changes in
thebirth-rate forit is certainthat, whateverchangeshave occurred
;
intherelativeratesofreproductionofdifferentclasses,thebirth-rate
of the country as a whole has diminished very greatly during this
period. Althoughthequestionsmayberepeatedinthecensusof 1931
it is clear that comparisons based upon statements of completed
families will, by the time they are made public, be already nearly
twenty years out of date. Direct information as to the course of
natality from year to year could, however, be obtained from the
numbersofbirthsregistered, providedtheages oftheparentsatsuch
times were recorded, and the occupation of the father, which is.now
recorded,werebroughtintoharmonywiththeoccupationalclassifica-
tion employedin the census.

In thesecond place, acompletely satisfactory comparison between
differentoccupationalgroups mustinvolve the mortalities occurring
in thosegroups, and the natalities as affected, not only bythe birth-
rates of married persons of a given age, but also by age at marriage
and frequency of celibacy. The basis for a complete biological com-
parisonis, infact, to be found only in the Malthusian parameter of
populationgrowth,ofwhichthetheorywas developedinChapterII
;
it is therefore only when the Malthusian parameters for different
occupationalgroupshavebeenestablished,thataquantitative know-
ledge of the biological situation will have been obtained. In all the
examplesto be givenit willbe seenthat ourknowledgefalls veryfar
shortof this level. Itisperhapsof minor importance that mortality,
except in early childhood, should have been generally ignored, for
this is certainly not the major factor of the comparison. Even with
respect to births, however, nearly all inquiries tend to confine them-
selvesto acomparison ofthe births tomarriedpersons ofafixedage,
and often assemble their data in such awayas toeliminate, asfaras
possible,theimportantfactorsofage atmarriage and celibacy. Itis,
ofcourse,desirableinitself,thatthesethreeelementsshouldbeevalu-
ated separately, and there are reasons to think that their separate
evaluationwillbeof servicein disentanglingthe causes ofthepheno-
menon. Yet, sinceno oneitemis ofthe same practicalsignificance as
the total effect, more is usually lost than gained by forms of tabula-
tion in which the totaleffect as such is ignored.

### Early investigations
One of the earliest important investigations was that carried out
byDr.DavidHeronuponthebirth-ratesinthedifferentmetropolitan
boroughs into which London is divided. His method consists in the
correlation of fertility with a number of indices of social status,
derived from the proportion of different occupations recorded in the
census. The districts in which the average social level is highest are
indicated by a high proportion of professional men and of domestic
servants, andbyalowproportionofgenerallabourers, pawnbrokers,
employedchildren,andoccupantsaveraging morethantwoinaroom.

The fertility was measured in 1901 by the birth-rate for a thousand
married women aged 15 to 54, and in 1851 by the birth-rate for a
thousand married women over 20. The birth-rate was found to be
closely associated with all indications of a lower social class. Both
epochs show the same general relationships between undesirable
social conditions andahighbirth-rate theintensity of this relation-
;
ship, however, has almost doubledintheintervalfrom 1851 to 1901.

The investigation is of particular interest in showing that in 1851 a
class difference in fertility had already developed, although of only
half theintensity ofthat shown attheend of the century. The com-
parison of intensity is, however, slightly obscured by the change
which Dr. Heron was obliged to make in the method of measuring
fertility, for the slightly inferior index used for 1851 would itself
probably diminish the intensity of the correlations obtained. It
should be remembered that the comparison is made only between
districts, and that what is demonstrated is no more than that, in
London, the poorest districts have the highest birth-rates. It does
notprovethatthepoorestclassesarethemselvesresponsibleforthese
birth-rates, although such ageneral associationis anaturalinference
from the results. The methods used, however, cannot be made to
distinguish whether the cause of the contrast is that the better paid
workman is less prolific than the worse paid, or merely that the
professional and salaried occupations are less prolific than the
working classesingeneral. The differences observedin this study do
notofcourseincludeanydifferencesintheincidenceofcelibacy, orin
the average duration of marriage before 45.

Thefirstnationalstatisticsinwhichsizeoffamilycanbecompared
with occupationalstatus were obtainedintheFrenchcensusof 1906.

Forfamilies of which the head was CO to 65 years old at the time of
that census, and still married, the average family was 3-60. For
employers (patrons) the average was 3-59, or almost equalto that of
thegeneralpopulation
;
forworkmen (ouvriers)itwas 4-04,whileamong
employesotherthan workmen itwasonly3-00. The patronsare more
thanhalffarmers, forwhomthe averageforthosemarriedmorethan
25 years is 3-71, while little more than a fifth of them belong to the
liberal professions, for whom the corresponding average is 3-30, or a
triflelessthanthatoftheemployes, otherthanworkmen,ifallowance
is made for the change in the basis of classification.

The classification of the census was, however, better fitted to
compare the conditions in different industries than to compare those
indifferentgradesofthesame
industry.

Freshevidencewasobtained
in 1907 from schedules of families filled in by a large number of
employees and workmen, in the pay of the state, and of various
provinces
and
parishes.

The averagesformarriageswhichhadlasted
more than fifteen years show for workmen a regular decrease in size
of family from the worst paid, with an average of 3-29, to the best
paid, earningfrom 160to 240ayear, with anaverage of 2-34. The
employees, inthe same wage-groups show a corresponding fall from
2-77 to 2-31. Those earningfrom 240 to 400 a yearshow afurther
fallto 2-29, while those earning more than 400ayearshowariseto
2-38. Itis clearfromtheseandtheprecedingfigures,thatinthebulk
oftheFrenchpopulation,earninglessthan 400ayear,reproduction,
at a period that must be referred back at least to the eighties and
nineties ofthe lastcentury, was much more active among the poorer
than among the better-paid classes. For officials earning more than
400 ayear, atwhich point the salary subdivisions cease, there was,
apparently a slight rise in reproduction, although within the more
prosperous classes the intellectual group represented by the liberal
professions had much fewer children than the average.

For Great Britain the fullest information so far made available is
that obtained from the census of 1911, but a number of private
investigations had already made clear individually the facts of the
greatest importance. Mr. Whetham in 1909 published the results of
astudy (FamilyandNation,p. 140)ofthe fertilityofthehigherranks
of the professional and official classes, in which he made use of the
information supplied by Who's Who. He finds that the average
number of children, recorded for marriedpersons inthis class, falls
from 5-19 to 3-08, in passing from those married before to those
married after 1870. He notes that for clergymen the diminution is
much less, and for military families considerably more, than for the
remainder. A similarinvestigation by the same author shows that,
for families that have held a peerage for at least three generations,
the average has fallen, according to the date of marriage, from 7-10
formarriages in the thirties of thelastcentury,to 3-13forthosecon-
tractedintheeighties. Althoughtheseinvestigationsare confinedto
a small fraction of the British people they reveal significant facts,
first astothe lowrate ofreproductionofthe English upperclassesof
the last generation, and secondly that this rate of reproduction was
falling during the latter half of the nineteenth century at a rate
greatlyexceedingthedeclineinthe fertilityofthegeneralpopulation.

It is sometimes imagined that the differences in reproduction
betweendifferentsocialclasses,dependuponcircumstancesandideas
peculiar to those who enjoy the advantages of leisure, or education,
orbothcombined. Itseemsfrequentlytohavebeendeemed probable
that where poverty is severe the most healthy and efficient will
reproduce theirkindthe most freely, as is the case with animals in a
state of nature. Whatever may have been the case in the past, a
careful and mostvaluableinvestigation has shown that data, drawn
fromthepoorestclassesintheindustrialtownsofBlackburn,Preston,
Glasgow, and Birmingham, and from the Royal Albert Asylum,
Lancaster, prove that the most capableamongtheseclasseshavethe
fewest children. The correlations found are not large, as is to be
expected when we deal withvariations within a populationofnearly
uniform culture. What is established beyond doubt is that, when
proper allowance is madeforthe age offather and mother thelarger
families subsist upon the smaller wages. In other words the poorer
wage earners have, at a given age, the greater number of surviving
children. Similarresultsareobtainedwhenothertestsofcapacity or
status, such as health, regularity of employment, temperance of the
father, orcleanlinessofthehome, aresubstitutedforwages. Ofthese
criteria the least satisfactory is the cleanliness of the home, since it
isprobablethatvisitors,ingradingthisvariate,donotmakeaccurate
allowance for the extra work entailed bythe largerfamilies.

### British data
Theresultsofthe censusof1911havebeenreporteduponseparately
by Dr. J. C. Dunlop for Scotland and Dr. T. H. C. Stevenson for
England. The two accounts differ considerably in the form in which
theresults arereported, and since theresults ofthetwo inquiriesare
closelysimilar,eachservesinseveralvaluablerespectstosupplement
theother. ForScotlandDr. Dunlopgives acomparativetableofthe
average numbers ofchildrenforalarge numberofoccupations. Only
marriages which had lasted fifteen years or more were utilized, and
the age at marriage of the wife was restricted to the five yearperiod
22 to 26. The average for all occupations is 5-82 children, and by
arranging the occupations in order of the average size offamily it is
easy to compare the socialstatusofthe most fertile, withthat ofthe
least fertile occupations. To avoid giving undue weightto the small
groups, for which the average fertility will not be very precisely
determined, we should also take account of the number of families
represented by each average. The most fertile occupations comprise
three large groups, namely, crofters 7-04, coal, shale and ironstone
miners 7-01, agricultural labourers and farm-servants 6-42; three
groups of moderate size, namely old-age pensioners 6-95, fisherman-
crofters 6*93, and coal heavers 6-61, besides the small group of
plasterers' labourers 7-OL Turning now to the least fertile occupa-
bionsthe onlylarge groupisthe verycompositeone ofclerks, scoring
4.38. Six groups of moderate size are the physicians and surgeons
3-91,advocatesandsolicitors3-92, literary andscientific4-09, school-
masters and teachers 4-25, art, music and drama 4-27, ministers and
clergymen 4-33. In addition there are three small groups of army
officers 3-76, dentists and assistants 3-86, and veterinary surgeons
4-00. The contrast between the social status of these two sets of
occupationsrequiresnostress. Amongtheleastfertilearethelearned
professions, and, among the most fertile, the poorest of manual
labourers. Thedifferencesintheaveragenumbers ofchildrenarethe
more remarkable owing to the severe restriction to which the age
of the mother has been subjected. Together with the restriction on
the duration of marriage, this is nearly equivalent to eliminating
,
between the different occupational classes, all such differences in
fertility as arise from differences in the frequency of celibacy, and in
the age of marriage. It clearly appears from the corresponding
English figures that the contrast between the real rates of reproduc-
tion in the different classes, is heightened by the inclusion of these
additional factors.

The census results are particularly valuable in showing that the
decrease offertility withimproved socialclass is not confinedto any
onesectionofthesocialscale, asitseemedtobeintheFrench
figures
already quoted, butisequally manifest fromthe verypoorestgroups
that can be compared, to the most distinguished occupations which
provide sufficient numbers on which to base a comparison.

Inseveralinstancesitis,moreover,possibletocomparethe
fertility
of groups which are essentially grades within the same occupations.

The comparison of these is of particular importance, because we
thereby eliminate the considerable factors of differences in locality
and of industrial environment, and in the absence of these, the
averages derived, even from the smaller occupational categories,
possessconsiderablesignificance and regularity. Thusthe threepairs
of categories in Dr. Dunlop's list, which seem to be strictly compar-
able, show us that bricklayers' labourers have more children than
bricklayers,thatagriculturallabourershavemorechildrenthanfarm
foremen, and that plasterers' labourers have more children than
plasterers.

Sinceineachofthesecomparisonsallvariationsinlocality,
andin the conditions ofemployment,mustbeshared,inasomewhat
strictproportion,betweenthetwogradesoflabour,thesecomparisons
display the fertility differences in the clearest light. Since 1911 the
classificationbyoccupations,usedinthecensus,hasbeenverygreatly
improved, especially by separating the classification by industries
fromtheclassificationbygrade oremploymentwithineachindustry,
and if the inquiry as to number of children is repeated in the census
of 1931, manymore comparisons between differentgrades ofworkers
in the same industry should become possible.

In 1920 Dr. Stevenson published an account of the results for
England and Wales in which special attention was given to over-
coming the difficultiesofobtaining conclusions of direct sociological
value from data, the collection of which had been, for that purpose,
very imperfectly planned. The occupational categories, although
they include distinctions both of industry andofoccupation proper,
could be roughly graded into live large sections, of which the first
represented the upper and middle classes, in a very generous inter-
pretationofthisterm,thethirdwasofskilledworkersandthefifthof
unskilled. Owingtotheabsenceofgradedistinctionsitwasnecessary
toomitfromthissubdivisionthethreegreatgroupsoftextileworkers,
coal miners, and agricultural labourers.

For the families of continuing fertility, i.e. where the wife was
under the age of 45 years atthe date of census, the average numbers
of living children for these five groups are 1-68, 2-05, 2-32, 2-37, and
2-68, the unskilled workers having on the average rather less than
twicethenumberofchildrenfoundinclass I. The greatest contrasts
are between classes I and II, with a difference 0-37, and classes IV
andV, with a difference 0-31, showing decided decreases in fertility
associated with the lower, as well as the higher, grades of ability.

Standardization withrespecttoageatmarriage anddurationofmar-
riagereduces the differences by about a third, thus showing that the
classes most fertile when married at any given age, also provide for
themselves by early marriage the greatest opportunity for fertility.

It also appears from the census report that the proportion married
islessintheprofessionalclassesthanintheremainderofthepopula-
tion. Consequently the disparity in reproduction receives contribu-
tions from three distinct sources. In the first place the upper classes
marryless, orremaincelibate more frequently
;
secondly they marry
later, and their wives during marriage are for a shorter time in the
reproductive period, and that in the later andless fertile portions of
that period ; thirdly, the number of children recorded is fewer, com-
pared to the number of wives of any given age. The third cause is
probably of recent growth, and may principally be ascribed to the
deliberatelimitationofbirths butitshouldbenotedthatthisexplana-
;
tion is not available for the important contribution of the first two
causes, which would tend to be diminished rather thanincreasedby
the increasing use of contraception.

Dr. Stevenson attempts to trace the earlier history of the relative
fertilityof differentclassesbycomparing the average families, in the
differentoccupationalgroups, separately for marriages contracted in
successive decades, back to 1851-61, from which marriages a suffi-
cient number of husbands survived to the 1911 census. The occupa-
tionalcontrastinthefertilitiesoftheseearlymarriagesisfoundtobe
considerably reduced, and Dr. Stevenson suggests that, if the com-
parison could have beencarried twenty years further back, a period
ofsubstantialequalitybetweenallclassesmighthavebeenmetwith.

The data from a single census, which is all that we possess, is, how-
ever, quite inadequate to supply the necessary information on this
subject for the marriages on which the census averages are based
;
are not arandom sample of those which would have been recorded
at an earlier census, but a sample strictly selected on the basis of
longevity. In pedigree data ofthe middle class it is common to find
appreciable correlation between fertility and longevity, and the
validityofthe earlierfigures mustbesubstantially affectedfromthis
cause. The argumentfrom convergence not only requires that the
occupational classification should be equally reliable for the oldest
groups, asforthosestillinemployment, but thatthe effect, upon the
fertility of the survivors, ofselection for longevity should be effec-
tively the same in all classes. From a series of comparable censiis
investigations some such extrapolation should be feasible, but since
theopportunitywaslostin 1921, theclassdifferencesinreproduction,
before the general fall of the birth-rate set in about 1875, can now
scarcelyberecovered. Itisclear,however,fromHeron'swork,which
we have quoted above, that substantial differences existed between
the different London boroughs prior to 1851. While the period of
classequalityisthusquitehypothetical,theincreaseinthedisparity,
since the middle of the nineteenth century cannot reasonably be
doubted.

The general decline in the birth-rate since the seventies has
affected all classes, though somewhat unequally. The decline has
been greateramongthemore prosperous, and less among the poorer,
classes. Thereseemstobenostatisticaljustificationfortheassertion
that the decline has 'spread from above downwards', nor is this
inherently probable, since propaganda amongthe poorest classes has
been characteristic of the neo-Malthusian movement from its incep-
tion. The point istobe emphasized, since it appearsto be somewhat
widely believed that the differential birth-rate, in so far as it is due
to deliberate family limitation, will automatically disappear, by the
simple process of the poorer classes adopting a practice more widely
prevalent among the more prosperous. The vital statistics of our
country give no ground whatever for this belief.

### Position in the U.S.A.

The American data on the connexion between reproduction and
social class resemble that for Great Britain, in displaying the main
lines of the phenomenon with unmistakable clarity, without supply-
ing any means of entering into quantitative detail. The official
method is to ascertain the number of children of the parents at the
registration of a new birth, a method which is not at all comparable
with the size of family recorded in a census. The average families,
however, of mothers in the age group 3544, should supply figures
which are comparable from class to class, and, as in the case of the
Scottish census, the occupational classes may be noted which have
highorlow averages. The followingoccupationallistsare taken from
Whitney and Huntingdon's Builders ofAmerica, in which work the
averageshavebeenreducedbyone-thirdinorderto obtainestimates
ofthe average numbers of children born in completedfamilies. This
adjustment of course does not affect the order of the occupations.

The year referred to by Whitney and Huntingdon is uncertain, but
closely parallelresults, with slightly lower fertility, are shown bythe
Bureau of Census report for 1925.

Inthe group with high fertility we have nine occupations with an
estimatedaveragefamilyof4-8. Thesearecoal-miners otherminers
; ;
farm labourers; farmers; building labourers; railway labourers;
railwayconstructionforemen
;
metalmoulders
;
and factorylabourers,
in order of decreasingfertility.

In the group with low fertility we have eleven occupations, with
an estimated average family of 2-6. These, in*order of increasing
fertility, are,physicians ; technicalengineers ; lawyers ; book-keepers ;
bankers
;
teachers
;
agents andcanvassers ;factoryofficials
;
insurance
agents
;
clerksinoffices,&c.

;
real-estateagents.

Thegroupoflow fertilitycomprisesalltheprofessionaloccupations
except that of clergymen, who come in the next group, while the
group with high fertility contains all classes of labourers, together
with only three other groups, among which the rural occupation of
farmers is conspicuous, in the same way as we have also seen in the
French figures. Onthe whole the American figures show asomewhat
wider range of variation than do those quoted from Scotland; for
example thecoal, shaleandironstoneminers in Scotland show 77per
cent, more children than do the physicians and surgeons, whereas in
America the miners exceed the physicians by 119 per cent. The use
of datafrom birth registration would be expected rather to diminish
than to increase the ratio, but the difference may perhaps be ac-
countedforbytwoothercircumstances, firstthattheageatmarriage
has been partially standardized in the Scottish figures, and secondly
that the American datafrom birth registration referto a much more
recent date than the nearly completed families of the 1911 census in
Scotland. It is not, therefore, certain that the differential incidence
ofthebirth-rateintheUnitedStates is, absolutely, greater thanthat
found in Great Britain, though it would be difficult to argue that it
could be appreciably less.

### Effects of differential fertility
Thefactsrevealedbythevital statisticsofthepresentcentury,with
respecttothe distributionoffertility, areinsuchstartlingopposition
totherationalanticipations oftheearliersociologists, thatitwillnot
be out of place to conclude this chapter with a few reflections upon
the sociological consequences, whichthe observed distribution of the
birth-rate, whatever may be its causes, inevitably carries with it.

(i) In the first place the language of evolutionary writers has
endowedtheword 'success' with a biologicalmeaning, bybestowing
itupon those individualsorsocieties, who,bytheirsuperiorcapacity
for survival and reproduction, are progressivelyreplacing their com-
petitors as living inhabitants of the earth. Itis this meaning that is
conveyedbytheexpression'successinthe struggleforexistence' and
this, it will probably be conceded, is the true nature of biological
success. To social man, however, success in human endeavour is
inseparable from the maintenance or attainment of social status;
wherever, then, the socially lower occupations are the more fertile,
we must face the paradox that the biologically successful members
of our society are to be found principally among its social failures,
and equally that classes of persons who are prosperous and socially
successful are, on the whole, the biological failures, the unfit of the
struggle for existence, doomed more or less speedily, according to
theirsocial distinction, to be eradicatedfrom the human stock. The
struggle for existence is, within such societies, the inverse of the
struggleforproperty andpower. The evolutionarytaskto whichthe
forces of selection are harnessed is to produce a type of man so
equipped in his instincts and faculties, that he will run the leastrisk
of attaining distinction, through qualities which are admired, or are
of service to society, or even of attaining such modest prosperity
and stabilityof usefulemployment as would place him in the middle
ranks ofself-supportingcitizens. In societies so constituted, we have
evidence of the absolute failure of the economic system to reconcile
the practice ofindividualreproductionwiththe permanentexistence
of a population fit, by their mutual services, for existence in society,
(ii) The existing evidence indicates that this curious inversion
exists throughout the civilized nations of the modern world. Of the
eastern civilizations of India andChinawe are, unfortunately, notin
a positiontoproducesatisfactorystatisticalevidence. Intheabsence
of European administration, the tremendous mortality among the
poorest class in these countries occasioned by war, pestilence, and
famine, must constitute a factor of great importance, and one that
might arrest the progress of racial deterioration, though at a some-
what low level, if the conditions were otherwise similar to those
observedintheWest. The prolongedphase ofstagnation andlackof
enterprise, from which both these peoples suffered before the impact
of European ideas, is at least suggestive of an equilibrium produced
by these means. Among ancient civilizationsthe testimony of Greek
andLatinwriters is, moreover, unanimous and convincing, indeclar-
ing that a similar inversion was vividly evident during the period
when the arts and social organization were most highly developed.

We mayrememberthattheLatinwordProletariifortheclassofcitizens
without capital property meant in effect 'The beggars who have
children', andthatnumerous,thoughperhapsineffective laws, ofthe
early Empire, were designed to encourage parentage among the
The causes which tend to induce the inversion of the birth-
(iii)
ratemustbe deferredtothenextchapter, but wemaynownote that
these causes must have encountered and overcome great natural
obstacles. Owing to the burden of parentage, and to the inheritance
of wealth, its constant tendency is to make the rich richer and the
poorpoorer. Suchatendencyisnotonlytobe deploredin the public
interest, as interfering with the distribution of wealth according to
the value of the services exchanged, and will therefore be resisted in
some measure by legislation, but, what is far more important, it
will be resisted in the economic interests of private individuals, as
would be a tendency to tax the poor more heavily than the rich.

The total burden of rearing the next generation of citizens would be
more easily borne, if distributed more in accordance with the ability
to support it. Those who can afford most of comforts and luxuries
can assuredly afford to have the most children, and upon purely
economic grounds, removed from all biological considerations, the
large households oftherichmightbereasonablyexpectedtoproduce
andsupport morechildrenthanthesmallhouseholdsofthepoor. We
have moreover no a priori reason to assume that mankind is an
exception to the rule, which holds for other organisms, whether of
plants or animals, that an increased abundance of the necessities of
life is favourable to reproduction.

The indirect effect of the favourable conditions of the more pros-
perous classes should also be borne in mind. If the optimal level of
fertility of species in general is determined by the requirements of
parentalcare, it is arelevantfact that the superior classes have, and
havehadin allages, thepowerto delegate alargeproportionoftheir
parental cares to others. The pressure of parental care is thereby
relieved, and the optimum level of fertility raised, as in the case of
the cuckoo. An obvious example is the provision of wet nurses for
thecareofinfants, acustomwhichmust greatlyincreasetheprospect
of an early conception by the mother. The physiological mechanism
by which this is brought about may be regarded as the means by
which the fertility is increased as soon as the natural burden of
parental care is removed, as it would be by the death of the infant.

Thesame principleappliestothecaresrequiredofparentsinreducing
the incidence of all infant and child mortality, and it is obvious
that, in so faras these carescan bedelegatedtoskilledprofessionals,
the biological optimum of fertility, in the privileged class, will be
progressivelyraised. If such a privileged class were biologically iso-
lated,itsinnate
fertility
wouldthereforeincreasetoahigherlevelthan
thatfoundin classes who hadto care fortheirown children,andthis
apart from the fact that, for the same level of innate fertility, the
more prosperous class should, in fact, be the more prolific.

Incomparativelyrecenttimeseffortshavebeenmadeonanational
scale to relieve the poverty of the poor, and make a reasonable pro-
vision for the education of their children, by direct taxation of the
higher incomes and the larger estates. An important factor, if not
the whole cause, of the need for this continual redistribution of
nationalwealth,evidentlyliesinthe disparitywithwhichtheburden
of parenthood is distributed and in its peculiarly heavy incidence
uponthepoorestclass. Enormousasistheexpenditureincurred, and
important as mayperhaps beitsbiologicalconsequences, inrelieving
the poorest class of much of the burden of parental care, and conse-
quently, though indirectly, increasing their fertility, it would be a
mistake to suppose that the burden of parental expenditure, in any
class ofself-supportingcitizens, is appreciably relieved. The support
ofanormalfamilyofthreeorfourchildrenentailsin the greater part
of our industrial population, a period of the harshest poverty, con-
trasting violently in comfort, security, and the possibility of saving,
with the standard of living which a childless man can enjoy on the
same wage. The economic pressure of low wages, while unable to
control the actual incidence of parenthood, with which it is in con-
flict, is yet able to inflict extreme hardship upon the mothers of the
nextgeneration anditis afeatureofoursocialsystemwhichshould
;
notbeoverlooked,thatanundulylargeproportionofeachgeneration
is derived from homes which have experienced the severity of this
conflict. The inversionof the birth-rate is afruitfulmother of social
discontent.

(iv) Intimately bound up with the concentration of reproductive
activity in the poorer classes of citizens, is a consequence, which, at
firstsight, hasits beneficialaspect, namelythatveryextensive social
promotion must take place in every generation, in order that the
numbersofthebetterpaidclassesmaymaintainaconstantproportion
to those of the worse paid. Socialpromotiondueto this cause must,
however, be distinguished from such normal promotion, due to in-
creasing age and experience, as will leave the children to start with
no greater social advantages than their parents, and also from that
relative promotion of special merit or talent, which allows the more
gifted, whether greatly, orinonlya slightdegree, aproperopportun-
ity for the exercise of their special abilities. Promotion of these two
kindsshould,ofcourse,characterizeanysocietywisely and generously
organized, whatever may be the distribution of reproduction within
it
;
andinwishingprosperitytodeservingmeritwe donotnecessarily
desire the continuous replacement of whole classes by those of
humbler origin,unless such replacement can be shown to conduce to
general prosperity. The sympathy which we feel, too, for the efforts
of dutiful parents, to aid their children to good fortune, would be
misplaced if it led us to desire the existence of increased numbers of
children who require good fortune to attain a useful and prosperous
way of life, and a decrease of those children who might claim such
a life as their birthright.

If we take account of the natural consequences which flow from
promotion throughout the whole social scale, involving the transfer
of many millions in every generation, we shall find some which may
be desirable, and others which are certainly harmful. In any body
of people whose parents andgrandparents occupied, on the average,
a distinctly humbler position than themselves, it is obvious that we
should not expect to find that pride of birth and ancestry, which is
characteristic of many uncivilized peoples. The conservative virtue,
which strives to live up to an honourable name, will be replaced by
the more progressive virtue, which strives to justify new claims. At
the worst pride of birth is replaced by pride of wealth, and popular
sentiment tends to grant the privileges of an aristocracy, rather to
the wealthy than to the well-born.

A second and less equivocal effect of wholesale social promotion
is the retardation of the cultural progress of every class of the com-
munity, by reason of the need to educate up to a higher level those
suffering from early disadvantages. The strain put by this factor
upon our educational system seems to be severe, and it doubtless
accounts, inlargemeasure,for the slow progress of genuine culture,
andforthe set-backs whichit seems, here and there, to be receiving.

This consequence of social promotion would, of course, show itself,
whateverthe hereditary aptitudes ofthe different classes might be.

The third and most serious disadvantage is that, whereas the
efficiency of the better paid classes may, in some measure, be main-
tained, by progressively perfecting the machinery for social promo-
3653 Q g
tion, in such away asto make the best use of everygrade of talent,
wherever it may be found, yet the worst-paid occupations have no
source from which they can recruit ability, and consequently suffer
a continual degradation in the average level of the talents they
possess. Without underestimating the value of the services, which
those promoted perform in their new spheres, it would be fatal to
ignore the extent to which the prosperity of any co-operative com-
munity rests upon the average efficiency of the great masses of citi-
zens, and, I should add, the extent to which its well-being rests on
the level at which their self-respect, enterprise and spirit can be
maintained.

### Summary

The different occupations of manin society are distinguishedeco-

nomically by the differences in the rewards which they procure.

Biologically they are of importance in insensibly controlling mate
selection, through the influences of prevailing opinion, mutual
interest, and the opportunities for social intercourse, which they
afford. Social classes thus become genetically differentiated, like
local varieties of a species, though the differentiation is determined,
not primarily by differences from class to class in selection, but by
the agencies controlling social promotion or demotion.

Comparisons between the vital statistics, and especially between
the birth-rates, of different classes, are generally defective andmuch
out of date. The principal need in our own countryis to bring the
occupational classification, used in the registration of births and
deaths, into harmonywiththatusedinthe census, andtorecordthe
ages of the parents in birth registration.

Numerousofinvestigations,inwhichthematterisapproachedfrom
different points of view, have shown, in all civilized countries for
which the data are available, that the birth-rate is much higher in
the poorer than in the more prosperous classes, and that this dif-
ference has been increasing in recentgenerations. As more complete
data have become available, it has appeared that this difference is
not confined to aristocratic or highly educated families, but extends
to the bottom of the social scale, in the contrast between the semi-
skilled and the unskilled labourers. There is no direct evidence of a
periodatwhichthebirth-rateinallclasseswas
equal,
andthedecline
in the birth-rate in all classes in recent decades has been apparently
simultaneous, though greater in the more prosperous classes.

Sincethebirth-rateisthepredominantfactorinhumansurvivalin
society, success in the struggle for existence is, in societies with an
invertedbirth-rate, the inverse of success inhumanendeavour. The
type of man selected, as the ancestor of future generations, is he
whose probability is least of winning admiration, or rewards, for
useful services to the society to which he belongs.

If, as is still uncertain, a similar inversion has prevailed in the
Asiatic centres of civilization, the mortality suffered by the poorest
class must have tended to arrest the progress of racial deterioration,
and had perhaps produced an equilibrium before the impact of
European ideas. The condition of the Roman empire was certainly
similarto that observed in modern countries.

The causes, which have produced the inversion of the birth-rate,
must have been sufficiently powerful to counteract both direct and
indirect economic agencies, favouring a higher birth-rate among the
more prosperous. By its tendency to make the rich richer and the
poor poorer, and, especially, to inflict hardship upon the parents of
the next generation, the inversion of the birth-rate is an important
cause of social discontent.

A
consequence which, at first sight, appears beneficial, is the very
large amount of social promotion which is required to maintain the
proportionoftheclasses. Uponexaminationitappearsthatthiskind
of promotion shouldnot be confused withincreasing prosperity, and
thatitcarrieswithit the seriousdisabilities of theretardation of the
culturalprogress of every class, andthe uncompensated depletion of
the poorest class in the ability to maintain their self-respect and
economic independence.

### History ofthe theory
WE
haveseeninthelastchapterthatamongcivilizedpeoples, both
in modern and ancient times, an anomalous condition has come into
existence, in which the more prosperous social classes, whom we
would naturally compare to the successful and well-adapted of an
animal species, reproduce their kind considerably more slowly than
the socially lower classes. In the ninth chapter we had seen reason
to conclude that the innate and heritable disposition has in civilized
man a powerful influence upon the rate of reproduction. It is now
proposed to show that a logical connexion exists between these two
conclusions. It is not denied that what may be called the accidents
of history have from time to time determined the social position of
various types of men, and have influenced the fertility of various
classes. Thewidespreadnatureofthephenomenonofthedifferential
birth-rate, existingingreatbodiesofpeople, indifferentnations, and
reappearing after long intervals oftime inentirely different civiliza-
tions, is not, however, to be explained by historical accidents. No
explanationofit canbe accepted, which does notflowfrom agencies
in almost universal operation, among civilized societies of the most
various types.

The theory to be here developed may be found in germ in an
interesting observationnotedbyFrancis Galtonin the course of his
genealogical researches; it has since been extended by several
writers, step by step with the advance of our knowledge of the
sociological phenomena, but neither its logical cogency, nor its im-
portance to sociological theory, seem to have been ever widely
grasped, and apart from a few ephemeral papers of my own, and a
brief discussioninMajor Darwin's recentbook TheNeed for Eugenic
Reform, it might be said to have been totally neglected.

InhisbookonHereditaryGenius,publishedin1869,Galtonconsiders
the problem presented by the generally acknowledged fact that the
families of great men tend, with unusual frequency, to die out. Of
thirty-one peerages received by the judges of England, twelve were
already extinct. Galtonexaminedthefamilyhistory ofthesethirty-
one peerages, andlit upon an explanation which he rightly describes
as 'Simple, adequate and novel'. A considerable proportion of the
new peers and of their sons had married heiresses.

But my statistical lists showed, with unmistakable emphasis, that
thesemarriagesarepeculiarlyunprolific. We mighthaveexpectedthat
anheiress, who isthesoleissue of amarriage,wouldnotbesofertileas
a woman who has many brothers and sisters. Comparative infertility
must be hereditaryin the same way as otherphysical attributes and I
am assuredthatitis so inthe case of domestic animals. Consequently
the issue of a peer's marriage with an heiress frequently fails and his
titleis broughttoanend.

After giving the individual histories of these families he arrived at
the following results.

(i) That out of 31 peerages there were no less than 17 in which the

After drawing similar conclusionsfrom other groups of peers Galton
continues
:
I tried the question from another side, by taking the marriages of
the last peers, and comparing the numbers of the children when the
motherwasanheiresswiththosewhenshewasnot. Itookprecautions
to exclude from the latter all cases where the mother was a coheiress,
orthefatheranonlyson. Alsosinceheiresses arenotso verycommon,
I sometimes went back two or three generations for an instance of an
heiress marriage. In this way I took fifty cases of each. I give them

I find that among the wives of peers 100 who are heiresses have 208
sons and 206 daughters, 100 who are not heiresses have 336 sons and
284 daughters.

The followingimportantparagraphsmayalsobequotedasshowing
the weight which Galton attached to this principle.

Every advancement in dignity is a fresh inducement to the intro-
duction of another heiress into the family. Consequently, Dukes have
agreaterimpregnationofheiressbloodthanEarls,andDukedomsmight
be expected to be more frequently extinguished than Earldoms, and
Earldoms to be more apt to go than Baronies. Experience shows this
to be most decidedly the case. SirBernardBurkeinhispreface tothe

It is with much satisfaction that I have traced and, I hope finally
disposedof,thecausewhyfamiliesareapttobecomeextinctinpropor-
tionto their dignity chiefly so, on account of my desire to show that

Unfortunately M. de Candolle associates this rational explanation
oftherelativeinfertilityoftheupperclasseswithotherssuchasthat
ofHerbert Spencer, whichevidently belongtothe categoryto which
Galtonhadhopedtoputanend. Norisitquite clearthathegrasped
thepointofGalton'sargument,whichisnotsomuchthatheiressescan
marry more easily than other girls, but that they may more reason-
ably aim at a marriage which is socially advantageous, and so are
liableto mingle theirtendenciesto sterility withthe naturalabilities
of exceptionally able men.

In a brief but important note contributed in 1913 to the Eugenics
Review, J. A. Cobb has given reasons for believing that the case of
heiresses, observed by Galton, is but a particular instance of a far
more generaltendency. Restrictinghimselftotheunconsciouscauses
ofrelativeinfertility, Mr. Cobb points out that,just asthe fortune of
an heiress enables her to make a socially advantageous marriage, so
among the children of parents of any class, members of the smaller
familieswillontheaverage commencelife atasocialadvantagecom-
pared to members of larger families. Alongside the many excellent
qualities whichenable afamilytoimproveitssocialposition, relative
infertilityalsoplaysitspart. Inthiswaythelessfertilestocks,having
the social advantage, will gradually permeate the upper classes of
society, and there cause the peculiar situation in which the more
fortunate and successful of mankind have the smallest birth-rate.

A quotation from Mr. Cobb's paper will enable the reader to
appreciate the point of view from which this important conclusion
Eugenists agree that the rising generation is largely recruited from
the less fit. This is attributedpartlyto the fact that the upperclasses
marrylaterand partlytothefactthatapartfromthequestionofpost-
ponementof marriagethe upper classes areless prolific thanthe lower.

There can be no doubt that atthepresenttime the smallerfertility
of the upper classes is almost entirely due to artificial limitation, but
there is another cause of their smaller fertility, and it is to this that I
wish to direct attention. It is important for the Eugenist to know to
what cause he is to attribute this smallerfertility of theupper classes
;
ifitis entirely due to artificiallimitation, whichismerely atemporary
fashion, the consequences are not likely to be very serious, since the
fashion for limiting the family is likely to take the usual course and
spreaddownwardsinthecommunity,eventuallyequalizingthe
fertility
in allranks of society; or the fashion may die out altogether when its
disastrous effect on the future of the race is perceived. It seems also
possible that the advantage of limiting the family will appeal more to
thepoorthantothe rich, for anadditionalchildis a greater burdento
thepoor, andperhaps eventuallytheartificiallimitationoffamilieswill
have a beneficial effect on therace by reducing the size ofthe families
ofthelessefficient.

If,however, asIshalltryto show, there is a naturaltendency under
modern conditions for the more intelligent to become less fertile, the
problemisamoreserious one.

If variations in fertility are inheritedandthewealthierclasses have
forgenerations beenputthrough aprocess ofselectionby which mem-
bers of smallfamilies have been given an advantage over members of
large families, we should expect that the wealthier classes would, as a
whole, belessfertilethanthepoorerclasses.

There must be some general cause which prevents the average in-
telligence in a civilized community from advancing beyond a certain
point. That cause seems to me to be the grading of society according
to a standard of wealth. This puts in the same class the children of
comparatively infertile parents andthe men of ability, andtheirinter-
marriage has the result of uniting sterility and ability.

### Infertility in all classes, irrespective of its cause, gains
social promotion
Inthe developmentofthetheoryby thethreewritersquoted,itis
evident that the progress made has consisted almost entirely in the
extension of the application of the principle to a wider and wider
range of social classes. This evidently followed merely from the
extensionof ourknowledge oftheclassesinwhich aninvertedbirth-
rate manifested itself. Galton was thinking principally of titled
families,becausehewasawarethatamongthesetheextinctionofthe
title took place with surprising frequency; De Candolle was aware
that alow birth-rate also characterized the rich bourgeois class, and
perceived immediately that the principle which Galton had dis-
covered, in the genealogies of titled families, must apply with equal
force wherever social position was greatly influenced by inherited
capital. It is probable that Cobb was not aware, in 1913, that the
resultsofthe census in 1911,inGreatBritain,showedthattheinver-
sionwas stronglydeveloped,eveninthepoorestclass
;
butheevidently
has no hesitationinbelieving thatit characterized thegreat mass of
thepopulation, andhisnotehas thegreat merit of applying theprin-
ciple to classes in which inheritedwealthis relatively unimportant.

That the economic situation in all grades of modern societies is
such as favours the social promotion of the less fertile is clear, from
a number of familiar considerations. In the wealthiest class, the
inherited property is for the most part divided among the natural
heirs, and the wealth of the child is inversely proportioned to the
number of the family to which he belongs. In the middle class the
effect of the direct inheritance of wealth is also important but the
;
anxiety of the parent of a largefamilyis increasedby the expense of
a first-class education, besides that of professional training, and by
theneedforcapitalinenteringtheprofessionstothebestadvantage.

At a lower economic level social status depends less upon actually
inherited capital than upon expenditure on housing, education,
amusements, and dress whilethesavingsofthe poor are depleted or
;
exhausted, and their prospects of economic progress often crippled,
by the necessity of sufficient food and clothing for their children.

These obvious facts are corroborated by the arguments upon which
thelimitationoffamiliesisadvocated ofthesebyfarthemostweighty

isthe parent'sdutyofgivingtohis childrenthebestpossible startin

ture an argument atleast as forcibleforthepoorasfortherich.

### Selection the predominant cause of the inverted birth-rate
It has been shown in Chapter IX that not merely physiological
infertility, but also the causes of low reproduction dependent upon
voluntary choice, such as celibacy, postponement of marriage, and
birth limitation by married couples, are also strongly influenced by
hereditary factors. The inclusion of the hereditary elements respon-
sible for these, to which are certainly due the greater part of the
variance in reproduction among civilizedmen, multiplies many-fold
the efficacy of the selective principle at work. We have seen in
particularthat hereditary differencesinthe mental andmoral quali-
tiesaffectingreproduction, mustbeofsuchamagnitudeastoproduce
considerable evolutionary changes, in the course of relatively short
historical periods, and that such changes have in fact taken place in
the moral temperament of peoples known to have been exposed to
the selective action of voluntary family limitation. Consequently it
is impossible to avoid the conclusion that, in a society in which
members of small families are on the average at a social advantage
compared to members of large families, the parents being in other
respects equivalent, society will become graded, not only in respect
of physiologicalinfertility, but much more rapidly andmore steeply
graded in respect of those temperamental differences which conduce
to celibacy, postponement of marriage and birth limitation.

This inclusive character of the theory when fully developed serves
to explain a characteristic of differential reproduction, which would
otherwise be quite unintelligible, namely that all the sociological
factors into which differential reproduction can be analysed, alike
exert theirinfluence in the same direction. If any single sociological
cause favoured contraceptive practices in the upper classes, as, for
example, freeraccesstomedicalknowledge mightbe supposedto do,
the effect to be expected would be a lower birth-rate to parents of
a given age, partially compensated in the statistical aggregate by
greater readiness to marry. -Equally, if something inherent in the
occupational conditions of the better-paid classes were supposed to
induce more frequent postponement of marriage, this cause, acting
alone, would be naturally accompanied by anincreasedbirth-rate of
those married in the higher age groups. What is actually observed,
however, is the concurrence in the more prosperous classes, of in-
creasedcelibacy, ofhigherage atmarriage, andof alowerbirth-rate
of married persons of a given age ; and this we should expect if the
effective cause ofthe phenomenon were the selective promotioninto
higher social strata of net infertility as such, irrespective of the
psychological causes which have inducedit.

It is possible to test in another way whether hereditaryinfluences
supply amajor and controlling causeofthedifferentialbirth-rate, or
aminorand subsidiary one. Evenin Galton'stime manycauseshad
been suggested for the portion of the phenomenon then known,
ascribing the differences in fertility to differences in social environ-
ment,ortosomeassumed physiologicalconnexionbetween
infertility
and the powers of the mind. Since then the list of suggestions has
increased: they may be exemplified by, excess of food, which the
upper social classes are presumably supposed to consume excess of
;
leisure the stress ofbrainwork the enervating influence of comfort.

; ;
However baseless the supposed causes may appear to be when each
isexaminedindetail,itiscertainlypossible a priori,thattheremight
be some subtle influence, of the social environment of the more
prosperousclasses, really unfavourabletoreproduction. The sharpest
possibletestbetweenthetwoviewswouldbetoascertaintherelative
fertilities, among men of a given social class, of those who had risen
rapidly inthe social scale as opposed to those who were borninthat
class. For,onthetheorythatwehavetodo principallywithheritable
factorsaffectingfertility, the fertilityoftheuppersocialclassesmust
be prevented from rising by the lower fertility of those whom social
promotion brings into their ranks ; the stream of demotion of the
morefertilemembersoftheupperclassesbeingrelativelyaveryfeeble
one. Consequently,thegroupsenjoyingrapidsocialpromotionshould,
onthis theory be even less fertile thantheclassesto whichthey rise.

If, on the contrary, the important causes were any of those to be
included under 'social environment', we should confidently expect
the families who rise in the social scale to carry with them some
measure of the fertility of the classes from which they originated.

We have seen that the differential birth-rate is strongly developed
intheUnited States, andatestistherefore affordedbyatable given
by Huntington and Whitney of the average number of childrenper
person in the American Who *s Who,whenthepersonsare subdivided
accordingtotheeducationtheyreceived. Theyaregivenindescend-
ing order.

Asthetotalnumberofpersonsdealtwithisabout25,000thetrend
of these averages cannot possibly be ascribed to chance ; the table
appears to show unmistakably, that among Americans who attain
a sufficient level of eminence to be included in Who's Who, those
whose socialpromotionhas beenmost striking have, onthe average,
fewerchildrenthanthosewhosesocialpromotionhasbeenless. Such
a result would appear inexplicable on any of the views that connect
the differential fertility of different classes with elements in their
socialenvironment, andis a striking confirmation of one ofthe most
unexpectedconsequencesofthetheorythatthedominatingcauselies
in the social promotion of the relatively infertile.

Whitney and Huntington give also the results of another inquiry
which bear upon the same problem. They have studied the average
abilities shown byYale students coming fromfamilies of 1, 2, 3 and
up to 6 or more. They find, in general, that the average abilityrises
as we pass from families of one, to families of two, and so on up to
the largest families. This, of course, is not at all what we should
expect to find, either in England or America, if we were to test
the sons of the population at large. In the population generally,the
classes which furnish the largest families would certainly show the
lowestaveragescores, whetherwetookascholastic, anathletic oran
intelligence test. The Yale students, however, are the sons of a
selected group of the population, of persons who can afford to give
theirchildrenanexpensiveeducation. This basis ofselectionfavours
themore prosperousparents, who, in sofarastheirprosperityis due
to innate causes, will be innately abler than the general population ;
but this selection of parentalprosperity will be much more stringent
for the parents of six or more children than for the parents of one
only. Remembering that the only child may be expected to have a
betterstartinlife ceterisparibus thanthe memberof afamily of six,
we may perhaps expectto find at Yale the only children of less suc-
cessful parents educated at equal expense and side by side with the
children ofthe more stringently selectedparents, who are able, with
families of six or more, stillto send them to Yale.

It is in fact a necessary consequence of our theory of the social
selectionof fertility, that, whereasinthepopulationatlargefertility
must become negatively correlated with such characters as intelli-
gence, which conduce to social promotion, yet, if we could select a
group of children about to enter the world with absolutely equal
social opportunities we should find, within this group, fertility
positivelycorrelatedwiththesecharacters. For parents whocan give
to a large family a certain level of educational advantage, could
certainly have launched a smaller family with greater advantages,
and must therefore possess a higher average level of qualities, apart
from fertility, favourable to social promotion, than do the parents
of smaller families whose children are actually receiving the same
advantages.

Ibelieveno investigationhas aimed at obtaining agroupinwhich
the educational advantages provided by the parents are completely
equalized, but the effect of a partial equalization, in raising the cor-
relationbetween fertility and intelligence, is shownbysomeinterest-
ing datapublishedbyH.E. G. SutherlandandGodfreyH. Thomson
in 1926. In an unselected group of 1924 elementary school children
oftheIsle ofWight, betweenthe agesof 10\ and \\\yearsacorrela-
tion coefficient, - 0-154, with a probable error 0-023, was obtained.

Since the correlation is negative and clearly significant, it appears
that, with this unselected group the least intelligent children belong
to the largest families. On the other hand 386 boys of the Royal
Grammar School, Newcastle-on-Tyne, the intelligence quotients of
which are statedto beveryreliable, and 395boys and girls ofMoray
HouseSchool,Edinburgh,showcorrelations - 0-058 0-04, and- 0-075
+0-034 both of which, though still negative, are insignificant in
magnitude. Since within the same school, even if of very definite
class, muchvariationmustexistinthe socialadvantageswith which
different pupils enter life, these data leave little doubt that in a
group in which these advantages were strictlyequalized the correla-
tion between fertility and intelligence would have been raised to a
positive value. It is obvious that such results are opposed to any
theorywhich implies a physiologicalopposition between fertility and
intelligence,
andareunintelligible upontheviewthatclassdifferences
of fertility are derivedwholly or indeed largely from class environ-
ment.

### The decay of ruling classes
The fact of the decline of past civilizations is the most patent in
history,
andsincebrilliantperiodshavefrequentlybeeninaugurated,
inthegreatcentresofcivilization, bytheinvasionofalienrulers,itis
recognizedthatthe immediate cause of decay must be the degenera-
tion or depletionofthe ruling class. Many speculative theories have
been putforwardin explanation of theremarkableimpermanence-of
suchclasses. Before proceedingfurtheritmay be as wellto consider
what elements of truth these suggestions may contain.

The Comte de Gobineau, to whose active mind the decline of
civilizations presented itself as the greatest of human problems,
believed that the disappearance of the original aristocracies was
universally
duetoracemixture. Othershavenothesitatedtoascribe
the infertility of the upper classes to inbreeding
;
but since this view
is now, on the biological side, universally discredited, it need not
be further considered. There was, on the other hand, nothing in
Gobineau*s theory of the effects of race mixture which could have
been disprovedbythe science of his time
;
iftheprogress ofgenetical
knowledge has rendered his views unlikely they would still have
claims to acceptance on anhistorical basis, were theythe only avail-
able explanation of the historicalfacts.

The general consequences of race mixture can be predicted with
confidence, without particular knowledge of the factors in which the
contrastedracesdiffer. Iftheracesandtheirdescendantsintermarry
freely, the factors which are inherited independently will be recom-
bined at random; each person of mixed race will resemble the one
parental stock in respect of some factors, and the other stock in
respect of others. Theirgeneral character willtherefore be interme-
diate, but their variability will be greater than that of the original
races. Moreover,newcombinations ofvirtue and ability, andoftheir
opposites, willappearinthe mixed race, combinations which are not
necessarily heterozygous, but may be fixed as permanent racial
characters. Therearethusinthemixedracegreatpossibilitiesforthe
action of selection. If selection is beneficent, and the better types
leave the greater number of descendants, the ultimate effect of mix-
ture will be the production of a race, not inferior to either of those
from which it sprang, but rather superior to both, in so far as the
advantages ofbothcanbecombined. Unfavourable selection, onthe
otherhand, will be more rapidly disastrous to a mixed race than to
its progenitors. It should of course be remembered that all existing
races show very great variability in respect of hereditary factors, so
that selections of the intensity to which mankind is exposed would
be capable of producing rapid changes, even in the purest existing
It does not seem unreasonable to conjecture that within each of
the great divisions ofmankind, internal adaptations oradjustments,
between the different faculties of the mind and body, have been
established duringthe long ages of selectionunder which these races
were originally formed. If this were true, the crossing of widely
different races would disturb this internal harmony and put the
mixedraceataninitialdisadvantage,fronjwhich,evenunderfavour-
able selection, it might take several generations to recover. The
theory of Gobineau depends upon the effect of intermixture of a
rulingaristocracy, whichGobineau invariablytracestotheEuropean
stock, to whose merits he ascribes the progress and stability of all
civilizations, with a mixed and coloured people inhabiting oneofthe
great andancient centres of population, such asChinaproper, orthe
valleys of the Ganges, the Euphrates or the Nile. Apart from his
assumptionoftheracialoriginoftherulers,thehistoricalimportance
of such cases cannot be doubted ; and it is in all respects probable
that, as intermixture progressed, the ruling class, in the absence of
selection, would entirelychangeits character ; the qualities bywhich
ithadbeendistinguished wouldbe diffused amongthose ofthe more
numerous race, and in the absence of native ability,'could no longer
achieve the great results, for which, concentrated in a ruling class,
they were originally responsible. Nevertheless, granting that the
processofracialdiffusionsetsacertaintermtoanycivilizationwhich
depends upon the virtues of an alien minority, it remains to be
explained why great civilizations should be assumed always to rest
upon so precarious a foundation. If the peoples of the world's great
centres of ancient population are inherently incapable of producing
of themselves a great and vigorous civilization, an explanation of so
remarkable a fact is certainly required. We cannot reasonably be
satisfiedbyacceptingit as anaccident, thatthegreatcivilizingraces
should have originally occupied only those regions of the earth,
where civilization was for so long unknown.

It has been suggested that the disappearance of ruling races of
foreignorigininancientcivilizationswasduetotheselectiveinfluence
of the climate. This theory stands in the same position as that of
race mixture, in respect of the main criticism to which the latter is
exposed. It does not explain why the foreign element should be
necessary. Apart from this it certainly appears to be a real factor
in the situation. Races exposed to anew climate, and to unfamiliar
diseases,arecertainlyinsomecasesatadisadvantageasregardstheir
death-rate, andprobably also as regards their birth-rate. As are the
negroes in centres of population infectedwith tuberculosis, orEuro-
peans in regions suffering from uncontrolled malaria.

In one respect the theory of selection by climate and disease ap-
pearstopossess anadvantageoverthatofracemixture. Ifthelatter
were the only agency at work, the disappearance of the ruling class
would be accompanied by a permanentimprovement ofthenatives.

The effect of successive conquests should accumulate; so that we
should expect that a people, such as the Egyptians, should be
reasonably far advanced towards the type of a ruling race. The
reverse appears to be the case. The effect of the selective influence
of climate and disease, on the other hand, would appear to undo
completely the racial benefits of an invasion. Further consideration
shows that both agencies acting together would lead to an inter-
mediate result, for in the distribution of the hereditary factors,
immunitytolocaldiseaseswouldoftenbecombinedwiththequalities
of the immigrants. This consideration suggests that unless selection
is directed against the qualities of the ruling race as such, some
permanent improvement of the native population is a necessary
consequence. On the other hand beneficial selection combined with
race mixture would lead to the formation of a race combining the
condition of acclimatization with the valuable qualities of the in-
vaders. It wouldseem then, from thehistory of ancient civilizations
in the East, that the rate of reproduction has never permanently
favoured the ruling classes. If we consider further that, in any
ordered society, the burden of maintaining the population is likely
to fall upon the parents, and that the possession of wealth is likely
sooner or later to be of social advantage, it is possible to offer a
rational explanation, not only of the disappearance of ruling classes
of foreign origin, but of the paucity ofthe necessary types of ability
from the indigenous population. It would seem not improbable on
this view that in its origin civilization was indigenous, favoured by
thenatural causes which admit ofadense population thatthe most
;
capable elements of this primitive civilization formed themselves
sooner or later into the upper classes, that they were slowly imbued
with those factors of heritable disposition which make for a reduced
prolificacy; and that with the consequent development of wholesale
social promotion, they were, by a rapidly increasing process, elimi-
nated from therace. Their territory, doweredwithimmensenatural
resources, and destitute of a vigorous and united government,
became the natural prey of a succession of invaders. Once it is
apparent that natural causes sufficiently explain the attenuation of
theoriginalrulers, thedisappearanceofaristocraciesofforeignorigin
raises no new problem. The same agencies which destroyed the
founders of a civilization are capable of destroying their successors ;
themore easilyiftheunfavourable action of selectionwerefurthered
by race mixture and the influence of climate.

The belief that the mere existence of civilized conditions causes
degeneracy among the races which experience them, has been held
by many writers, and is strongly supported by the instances of bar-
barous territories which have received the civilization, and shared
the decay, of some more advancedstate. The people of Roman Gaul
and Britain, originally hardy andwarlike, were, during the decay of
Roman power, scarcely more capable ofsupporting andsafeguarding
their civilization, than were the Romans they fell a natural prey
;
to inferiornumbers of warlike barbarians, without suffering from a
foreign climate, orfrom intermixture with aninferiorrace.

No explanation of the manner in which civilization produces this
deleterious effect, byreferenceto theinheritance of acquiredcharac-
ters, cannowberegardedassatisfactory; and in any case it must be
doubted if the characters acquired in a state of civilization, which
include habits of industry and discipline, in addition to the training
of the intellectual faculties, can be regarded as unfitting a people to
holditsown. It is saidthatluxury sapsthe vigour, anddependence
the initiative of civilized peoples, and even if this were the unquali-
fied truth as to the effect upon the individual of civilized life, the
first generation of misfortune should restore the vigour, and give
unexampled opportunities to the initiative, of athreatened people.

Weknowthat thetide ofsocialpromotionthroughouttheRoman
dominion must have flowed rapidly. The demand for men for the
Imperialservices extended freely to provincials, andinthe commer-
cial and industrial development of the provinces a large scope was
given to the initiative of all, even in their home towns. The upper
classes, and especially the wealthier of these, were certainly drawn
intothevortexofacosmopolitansociety,recruitingitself extensively
fromthelowerorders. Gaulswereadmittedtothe Senateasearlyas
the reign of Claudius, who first occupied Britain. With these facts
in mind it is not surprising that after several hundred years absorp-
tion in the Roman civilization, Britain and Gaul showed scarcely
greater capacity for resistance than the older provinces. For even

### Contrast with barbarian societies
Itappears, then,thatthe socialselection of infertility willcharac-
terize all states of society in which (1) distinctions of social class
exist ; (2) wealthisinfluentialindeterminingthesocialpositionof an
individualorhisdescendants; and
(3)
theeconomic chargeofproduc-
ing the next generation is borne exclusively or principally by the
parents who producethem, atleastinthesensethattheywouldhave
beenbetteroffhadtheyproducedfewer. Theseconditionsareofsuch
wide application that we canhaveno hesitation inpostulating them
inallsocieties,ancientormodern,consistingofindividualsco-operat-
ingformutualadvantage in a stateoflaw and order. The essentially
dysgenic features of the situation may, however, be expressed more
aptly by saying that they are implied by the existence of a dif-
ferentiation of social class in which socialpromotion, or demotion, is
determinedbythecombinationoftwodifferentattributes
(1)socially
valuable qualities, and (2) infertility. It is thus not quite exact to
say that the selective agency considered must be dysgenic in any
society graded according to wealth; this would imply too wide an
application of the principle, for gradations of wealth in the form of
the control of material property, and authority over the services of
others,wouldseemtobeinseparable fromanyorganizationofsociety
whatever.

There have certainly existed societies, though not properly speak-
ing civilized societies, in which the institution of social class was
highly developed, in which the power and prestige of the individual
rested largely upon his pedigree and kinship, in which these class
distinctions were doubtless correlated with personal wealth, and in
which,nevertheless,thesocialadvantagelaywiththelargerfamilies.

Since in such societies we should infer from the principle of the
inheritance offertility, andtheabsenceofanycountervailingcauses,
that the fertility of the socially superior should be the higher, and
consequently that the powerful evolutionary force, which such dif-
ference of fertility has been shown to exert, will be directed towards
the increase of the qualities favourable to success in these societies,
andtothe qualities admiredinthem, theirimportance forthe study
of our theory, and for the evolutionary history of mankind, is very
great.

The state of societywith whichwe are hereconcerned, whichmay
be exemplified by the primitive peoples of Northern Europe, as
represented in the Icelandic Sagas, in Tacitus' description of the
Germans, and probably in the Homeric poems, by the pre-Islamic
BedouinoftheArabiandesert,bymany,ifnot all,oftheTurkishand
Tartarpeoples oftheCentralAsiatic steppes, andbythePolynesians
of NewZealandand Samoa, ischaracterizedbyatribalorganization,
influenced, or indeed dominated, bythe blood feud. Alltheseshow
astrongfeelingforaristocraticorclassdistinction, andthischaracter,
aswellas the bloodfeud, seems to be rather rare among uncivilized
peoples generally. For this reason it is convenient to designate this
particular type of society by a special term, which shall contrast
them with civilized, and distinguish them from the other uncivilized
peoples. We may conveniently call them barbarians. This term
is the more appropriate in that the examples given, few as they are,
include the most important groups of peoples, who have, in the
course of history, overrun the great centres of relatively permanent
civilization, andto whomthe existing organization of society can be
traced back in historical continuity.

Different civilized nations, although potentially at war with one
another, mayyet show essentiallythe same ideas, and an equivalent
development of material civilization. The cultural unity of different
barbarian tribes is usually much closer, for they are bound together
by common language,

andacommonoralliterature,intermarry much
more frequently than can the large aggregates which constitute
civilized nations, andfrequent the same fairs andfestivals fortrade,
religion or recreation. It is necessary to emphasize this unity of
culture because, unlike civilized societies having comparable unity,
barbarian peoples recognize private, or more properly tribal war as
a normal means for avenging and checking crime. The obligation to
avenge a kinsman was felt extremely keenly as a moral duty, to
shirk which would be incompatible with self-respect or an easy con-
science, or, in Wilfred Blunt's forcible phrase as 'almost a physical
necessity'. The existence of this obligation requires that the
tribes of kinsmen to which it applies shall be somewhat sharply
defined, and with this obligation follows, ofcourse,theobligationto
pay, and the right to share, blood money, or to share in booty. A
certain degree of economic communism thus characterizes these
kindredgroups, so thatthere is little exaggerationin sayingthatthe
economicandthemilitaryunitsinsuchsocietiesaremadetocoincide.

This is at least a convenientform in which to express the contrast
withallcivilizedsocieties,inwhichtheinterestsoftheeconomicunit,
consisting of a single individual and his dependents, may differ
widelyfromthose ofthemilitaryunit, consistingoftheentirenation
to which he belongs. The interests of the kindred group as a whole,
whose rightstolifeandpropertycanonlybe safeguardedbymilitary
preparedness, areofcourse, inthefirstdegree, foundeduponmilitary
strength, and consequently, among otherqualities, upon the fertility
ofits members.

Social position in barbarian societies consists partly in differences
A
in kind, partly in differences in degree. powerfulgroup comprises
not only the body of free tribesmen of authentic, or noble, pedigree,
but also dependent freemen harboured by the tribe, who may have
beenoutlawedfromtheirown tribes, orbetheremnants oftribestoo
weak to stand by themselves further there may be unfree depen-
;
dents, whose position only differs from that of the slaves of civilized
societies, in lacking the protection of civil law, and, on the other
hand,indiffering butlittlefromtheirmastersineducationorstandard
ofliving. Itisimportant here that differencesinsocialstanding are
at least as stronglyfelt among barbarian peoples, as in civilization,
and that it istherebasednot so much on occupation, as on personal
and family prestige. Such differences in prestige are not, however,
confined to social distinctions within the tribe, but extend to great
differences in the repute and distinction of different kindred groups,
according to their exploits and power.

Itwillbe admitted, therefore, thatinsuchbarbaric societies as we
have described, well-defined class distinctions are combined with a
distinct social advantage of the more prolific stocks. Nor can we
doubtonindependentevidencethatthefamiliesofthehighestrepute
wereinfactthemost prolific. The highimportancegiventopedigree,
andthecaretakentopreservethenames, evenofaremote
ancestry,
is evidence of this; for such care would not generally be taken to
preserve the memory of ancestors, if these were on the average less
distinguished than their descendants. We can thus understand one
of the factors which enables suchpeoples to base theirsocialsystem
uponbloodrelationship. Thisevidenceindicates, moreover, notonly
a higherbirth-rate but a greater natural increase, when the death-
rate also is taken into account. It may well be suspected that the
most eminent families suffered in war the highest death-rate, but in
thesevere losseswhichbarbarianpeoples sufferintimesof dearth or
enforced migration, the more powerful groups would certainly be at
asubstantialadvantage
;
and
if,
aswehaveseen,selectionwouldtend
to increase their innate fertility above that of the less distinguished
groups, it is not surprising that we should be led to conclude that
society was derivedgeneration aftergeneration, predominantlyfrom
its more successful members.

The most important consequence of this conclusion is thathuman
evolution, at least in certain very ancient states of society, has
proceeded by an agency much more powerful than the direct selec-
tionofindividuals, namely the socialpromotion of fertility into the
superior social strata. In particular, it is importantthatthe quali-
ties recognized by man as socially valuable, should have been the
objective of such a selective agency, for it has hitherto only been
possible to ascribetheirevolutionarydevelopmentto the selectionof
wholeorganizedgroups, comparabletothehivesofthesocialinsects.

The selection of whole groups is, however, a much slower process
than the selection of individuals, and in view of the length of the
generation in man the evolution of his higher mental faculties, and
especially of the self-sacrificing element in his moral nature, would
seem to require the action of group selection over an immense
period. Amongthehigher humanfacultiesmustmoreoverbecounted
the power of aesthetic appreciation of, or emotional response to,
those qualities which we regard as the highest in human nature. It
will aid the reader to weigh the efficacy of the social advantage of
fertility in barbarous societies, if we analyse in more detail its re-
actions upon a single group of qualities typical of barbarian culture.

### Heroism and the higher human faculties

Thesocialideasofallpeoples knowntousinthestageofemergence

from the barbaric condition are dominated by the conception of
heroism, andcivilizedpeoplesnormallylookbacktoso-called 'heroic
ages' in which this conception moulded to an important degree the
structure of society. The emotional influence of this idea has been
sogreat,especiallythroughthepoetictradition, that it is difficult to
give a technically accurate characterization of the phenomenon
withoutusingtermschargedwithrhetoricalassociations. Thereader
mustrememberthatwe arenotconcernedto evaluateheroismeither
through praise or disparagement, but merely to consider its nature
and implications as a sociological phenomenon.

The hero is one fitted constitutionally to encounter danger; he
therefore exercises a certain inevitable authorityin hazardous enter-
prises,formenwillonlyreadilyfollowonewho
gives
themsomehope
of success. Hazardous enterprises, however, are not anecessity save
for the men who, as enemies or leaders, make them so, and the high
esteem in which tradition surrounds certain forms of definite im-
prudence cannot be ascribedto any just appreciationof the chances
of success. In modern times it is obvious that a man with any
immoderate heritage of this quality has anincreased probability of
perishing young in some possibly useful border expedition, besides
an increased probability of entering an occupation not easily to be
reconciled with family life. It is undeniable that current social
selection is unfavourable to heroism, at least in that degree which
findsitsweetaswellas propertogive one'slifeforhis country. Any
great warwillreveal, I believe, a great fund oflatent heroism in the
body of almost any people, though any great war must sensibly
diminish this fund. No one will, however, doubt that in respect of
prudence, long civilized peoples do differmateriallyfrom those races
in which the highest personal ambition of almost every man was to
win renown through heroic achievement.

An examination ofthe action of selectionin barbarous societies in
the tribal condition, reveals the possibility of the selection of the
heroic qualities beyond the limits set by prudence, by a method
analogous to that used in Chapter VII to explain the evolution of
distastefulqualitiesininsectlarvae. Themerefactthattheprosperity
ofthe group is at stake makes the sacrifice of individuallives occa-
sionally advantageous, though this, I believe, is a minor considera-
tioncomparedwiththeenormousadvantageconferredbytheprestige
of the hero upon all his kinsmen. The material advantage of such
prestigein barbarous society will, I think, scarcely be questioned ; it
is evident in all the heroic literature ; it is directly evidenced by the
deliberate vaunting of tribal achievements by professional poets;
equally convincing is the great importance attached to genealogy in
all such societies, by which the living boast their descent from the
mightydead. The positive aimbeforetheheroisundyingfame, heis
therefore bound to all that is of good repute ; to the heroic spirit all
material achievements are of lesser importance. Equally important
withthephenomenonofheroismitselfistheesteeminwhichitisheld.

Itisinevitableinatribalstate ofsocietythatcertainstocksshould

assume that such qualities do in fact benefittheirtribesmen, which
benefitcanbemost
readily
understoodthroughtheeffectsofprestige,
thenin a tribal societyheroism may become a predominant quality.

In this matter sexual selection seems in man to have played a most
important role. I do not here specially stress the evidence of the
poetic tradition, which,inspite ofthereputationof poets foreffemi-
nacy, insists on associating heroism with true love. I should rather
rely on the actual marriage customs of barbarous peoples. It should
be emphasized that in such marriages the political element is more
inevidencethantheromantic,withouttheirbeingthelessdominated
A
bytheemotionalreactions. marriageislikelytoinvolvebloodfeud
obligations;
unionwithapowerfulkindredisanessentialasset. The
corporate tribe is interested in the match, and sexual selection is
most powerfully exerted by tribal opinion. The prestige of the con-
tracting parties is all-important, and while this is partly personal, it
also is largely tribal. The wooer relies upon his reputation even for
the decision of the lady herself. Both in the Icelandic sagas and in
the pre-Islamic poems,marriages are nearlyalways promptedbythe
political aspirations of the parties.

Such sexualselectionbypublic opinion mustinfluencemanyother
qualities besides valour. Beauty, highmindedness and every other
highly esteemed quality must be thereby enhanced. Its importance
forus is thatitinfluences the esteem in which the group of qualities
most closely associated with heroism are held. Just as the power of

so in abarbarous society, in which the heroic qualities do possess an
intrinsic tribaladvantage, thepowerto appreciate andtheproneness
toadmiresuch qualitieswillbeenhanced,solongatleastasreproduc-
tionisactuallygreatestinthepredominantfamilies. Thereaderwho
will candidly compare the current attitude towards rash actions in
any long civilized society with that among the peoples under dis-
cussion, will scarcely doubt that the hero-worship of barbarous
peoples was in fact a mental attitude which, however useless to
modern man, played in their lives a very essential part. Changed
conditionswhichhavereversedthe advantage oftheheroicqualities,
have also reversed the advantage of being able to recognize and
appreciate them. It is obvious that the barbarous element in the
tradition of our culture is that which emphasizes and indeed exag-
gerates,thenaturalinequalityofman,whereasthereligious and
legal
elements emphasize his civil equality. From the fact that the bar-
bariansvaluedmore highlycertainqualities ofhuman character,itis
afairinferencethattheyperceivedsuchdifferencesmore
clearly
than
do civilizedmen. Directevidenceonthispointis necessarilyelusive.

On questions on whichwe are better informed than our ancestors it
is easy for us to perceive the evidences of our advantage. If the
reverse were the case, it would be easier for our ancestors than for
ourselves to point out the difference. The only objective fact known
to me relevant to the present issue is that moderns with highly
trained powers of appreciation do find in the earliest examples of
extantpoetryacertainelusivequalityinthedelineationofcharacter,
which gives to suchverse arecognizable supremacyin the particular
literature to which it belongs.

Itis, ofcourse, difficulttodistinguishbetweennon-percipience and
indifference to the distinctions perceived. The antipodes to the
spontaneous choice of emotional passion is exhibited in the account
given by Risley of the importance of a University degree in the
Bengalese marriage market. The successful candidate who emerges
with anM.A. becomes instantly, and invirtue of this alienqualifica-
tion, ahighlyeligiblematch, andmaycollectinafewmonthsaseries
of endowered brides. It would be difficult to decide whether this
throwing upon the board of examiners the onus of grading the
candidates in sexual selection is due to those personal differences,
which still to some extent influence European lovers, being but
faintly perceived, or, although perceived, to their being esteemed of
much less realimportance than the University degree.

Among peoples with a considerable contribution of the barbarous
elementintheirsocialtraditionthepredominantnon-personalfactor
in mate selectionis socialclass. Socialclassmay,aswehaveseen,be
bestdefinedas asynthesis of such distinctionsaswealth,occupation,
and family as influence eligibility in marriage, taking account of
these distinctions only in so far as they do in fact influence such
eligibility. Historically this distinction of social class is continuous
with the political and romantic prestige of the predominant clans.

It is thus not an accident that the social ostentation of earlier days
shouldsurvivemostconspicuouslyinweddings. Theattenuationand
decay of the sentiment of class distinction is the necessary con-
comitant of the progressive elimination of those elements of the
populationwhichenjoythehigherrank. Itwillbe readilyunderstood,
if the supposition is correct that among barbarian peoples the pre-
dominant class did in fact enjoy a selective advantage, that aristo-
cratic institutions should appear to peoples recently civilized to be
based on natural
justice.

To summarize the points of sociological importance: (i) A bar-
barian people organizedin kindredgroups and recognizingthe blood
feudastheprincipleofsocialcohesion, canscarcelyfailtoexperience
a selection in favour of two qualities on which the success of the
kindred group principally depends (a) the public spirited, patriotic,
or heroic disposition (b) fertility, (ii) The stratification of society in
these two qualities implies a selective advantage of the heroic tem-
perament beyond the optimum advantage ascribable to prudent
boldness, byreason ofthe social advantage offame orheroicreputa-
tion, (iii) The power of recognizing the heroic qualities, and of con-
scious choice in intermarriage, introduces the dual effect of sexual
selectioninintensifying boththequalitiesselectedandthecommunal
recognition and appreciation of such qualities, (iv) This selection of
the popular emotional response to the heroic qualities has the im-
portant effects of (a) stabilizing the foundations of the system by
strengtheningtheexistingbasisofsocialcohesion,
(b)
intensifyingthe
selective advantage ascribable tofame or prestige, (c) increasing the
selective advantage of all qualities consciously envisaged in sexual
selection, (d) exaggerating the realities of natural inequality by the
development of an extreme aristocratic doctrine of hereditary nobil-
ity. It is important to notice that such practices as polygamy or
servile concubinage are not in any sense primary principles of the
systemof causes described, butmaybe graftedintothesysteminso
far as they harmonize with the prestige of the hero, or the fertility
of his class. Such practices necessarily decay or are transformed to
fulfil a secondary socialpurpose, such as domestic service, as soon as
the main conditions of the system are undermined.

### The place of social class in human evolution
The combination of conditions which allows of the utilization of
differential fertility for the acceleration of evolutionary changes,
either progressive or destructive, seems to be peculiar to man. It
requires a social organism, and one which is individualistic inrepro-
duction. Accessory factors of great importance are the elasticity of
effective fertility, introduced by infanticide and other methods of
family limitation, and the peculiarly heavy burden of parental care
occasioned by the extraordinary long childhood of the human race.

Up to a certain stage, which was almost certainly prehuman, the
ancestors of manweredoubtlesssolitaryanimals, anduntilsociallife
began to be developedtheirfertility must have been stabilized at or
near the optimum appropriate to the requirements of parental care.

It is to be presumed that infanticide came to be practised, in conse-
quence of an increasing foresight of impending hardships, at an
exceedinglyremote period, perhaps earlyinman's history as asocial
animal. During theimmense period of early sociallife he appears to
have learnt to co-operate with his fellows, probably by sympathy
with their expressed emotions, instinctively to shun social oppro-
brium, and perhaps to improve his chances of posterity by mate
selection. The sentiment of preference, seems at least so essentialto
the sexual instincts of man that it is difficult to doubt that sexual
selectionwas earlyestablishedinmankind,thoughitmaybethatthe
specialconditionsexperiencedbytheirbarbarianancestorsprejudices
the opinion of civilized man in this matter. Apartfrom thisfactor,
theevolutionof manintheearlysocialstages musthavebeendirected

Atsome stage,theperiodofwhichitwouldbeuselesstoconjecture,
societies must have come into existence, in which some degree of
continuityof socialclasswasensuredbytheinheritance ofproperty,
privilege, prestige or social function, and in which individual dif-
ferences in the socially valuable qualities were strongly appreciated,
and allowed to contribute towards the assessment of socialrank. If
these characteristics, perhaps in quite a rudimentary form, were
combinedwithatribalorganization ofsociety,inwhichtherights of
each kindred group were established ultimately upon its military
power, so that the most fertile were mingled with the most admired

suchsocieties. Thenewforceactedthrough, andbymeans

bothinthe socialselection, andinthe sexualselection whichformed
a part of it, was doubtless guided, from the first, by the interests of
thetribalgroup,orofsocietyasawhole. Suchaprocessprovidesthe
means of relatively rapid evolutionary progress in qualities which
subordinate the individual interest to that of others, the evolution
of which, merely by the selective elimination of entire societies,
would seem to be extraordinarily slow. It has, however, all the
dangersnotedinthecaseofsexualselection, ofrunningintoextrava-
gance

step, with the qualities to which preference is given, and it may,
indeed,bethatsomeofthevirtueswhichappealmosttoourimagina-
tion are more of the nature of ornaments than of serviceable moral
ideals. Among the qualities which seem to have been extravagantly
developed among all barbarian peoples are personal and family
pride, and, but for the sharp lessons which must always be learnt in
aharshenvironment,madeharsherbymutualwarfare,extravagances
ofthis kind might, it would seem, have become much more common
than they are inman's moral nature.

It would be of greatinterest, if it were possible, to compare the
rapidityofprogressamongbarbarianpeoples,withthatofthedecline
among the civilized. The variations available for evolutionary
changes of a destructive nature must be so much more abundant
than those available for progressive changes, that we might expect
selective intensities of the same order to take some hundreds, or
perhaps a thousand generations, to build up in their perfection
attributes of the mind, which ten generations of adverse selection
might demolish. It does not appear that there should be any great
difference in the selective intensities developed in the two cases, if
eachwereinasteadystate. Theeffectofdifferencesoffertility would
be increased in the barbarian condition, and diminished among
civilized man, by the direct action of prosperity in favouring repro-
duction,
andthismightseemtomakethefavourableselectionamong
barbarian peoples more intense than the unfavourable selection
among the civilized. Against this should, I believe, be set the fact
that, although uncivilized peoples, by practising infanticide, can
produce as great avariationinnet fertility as canbirthlimitationin
civilized man, yet the selective effect of these differences in fertility
must,inaharshenvironment,bemuchdiminishedbyheaviermortal-
ity in infancy and childhood, so that the net differences of fertility
available may be less. With respect to the action of sexualselection
it might be thought that this factor, while accelerating progress
among barbarians, must be retarding decay among the civilized.

But this is certainly not the case in a societyin which the prospects
of fertility diminish with social advancement, for in such a society
itwill, onthe average, be biologically advantageous, tomake, oftwo
possible marriages, that which is socially the less eligible. Moreover
those who are most particular in the choice of a mate will most
frequently dimmish their fertility by postponement of marriage or
celibacy. Consequently sexual selection mustbe judgedto intensify
the speed of whichever process, constructive or degenerative, is in
action. The intensity of this influence must, however, be much
diminishedinthe later stages of civilized societies, with the decay of
the appreciation of personal differences.

### Analogy ofparasitism among ants

Thereactionofeconomiccausesuponthedistributionoffertilityin

human civilization is so disastrous that we could scarcely expect to
find it adequately paralleled in insect societies, for among these an
activeintercommunalselectionappearsalwaystobe
possible.

Never-
theless the interpretation put by Forel upon the reaction of the ant
Tetramorium cespitum to a ratherrare parasitic antStrongylognathus
testaceus is sufficiently apposite to be compared to the human situa-
tion. The structure oftheparasitic antsuggeststhatitwasformerly
a slavemaker, butitis now too feeble to be an effective combatant,
and the mixed colonies rely for defence upon the host workers. The
parasiteneuters, though ableto excavate andtofeedindependently,
contributelittleornothingtothestructureofthenest, andprobably
obtain most of their food from the tongues of the hosts. They take
no partinthecare oftheyoung, even oftheirown queen, and, being
thus apparently a survival useless to their own species, it is not
surprising that they are produced in relatively scanty numbers
comparedtothemalesand queens,whichareverysmallandproduced
in abundance. The sexual forms of the host, on the other hand, are
relatively enormous, since the queens have to supply the biological
capitalforfounding new andindependent colonies. Inmost cases of
ant parasitism the mother of the parasitized community is in some
manner or other eliminated, and the parasitism consists in the ex-
ploitation ofthe social instincts of the surviving workers for rearing
an alien brood. The case under consideration is peculiar in that it
appears to be well established that the host queen continues to live
and, in addition to the parasite queen, to lay, in the parasitized
colony
;
butthatinthis condition she neverproduces fertilefemales,
the parasites thus gaining a continual supply of host workers to
house, feed, educate and defend them, while the fertile queens
issuing from the nest are of the parasite species only. Forel ascribes
this remarkable condition to the regulatory or economic instincts of
thehostworkers,forthefemalesandmalesoftheparasitearesmaller
and lesstroublesome to nourish. This, he says,isevidentlysufficient
toinducethehostworkerstoreartheminplaceoftheirownenormous
queens and males, the larvae of which they therefore undoubtedly
devour or neglect, as they do in the case of all that seems to be
superfluous.

Whether ornot Forelis right inthis interpretation, his suggestion
illustrateswelltheeffect ofeconomic law, if allowedblindlyto actin
the regulation of fertility. Since the parasites are found in only a
small proportion of the Tetramorium nests, these insects have pre-
sumably some defensive instincts, which usually succeed in resisting
infestation. In human societies man is his own parasite, a circum-
stance which seems to ensure that allcivilized societies shallbe fully
infested.

### Summary

Inaccordancewiththetheory,developedwithsuccessiveextensions

byGalton, De Candolle, andJ.A. Cobb, itisshownthattheinversion

fully demonstrated: (i) The inheritance of the characters, whether
physical or psychological, determining reproduction ; (ii) The social
promotionofthelessfertile. Thevarioustheorieswhichhavesought
todiscoverinwealthacauseofinfertility, havemissedthepointthat
infertility is an important cause of wealth.

In the light of this theory we can understand how it is that the
more prosperous classes, not onlyhave fewer children when married
andatagiven

butthattheyalsotendtomarrylaterin

and
to remain more frequently celibate, than do less prosperous classes.

We can understand how it is, although the poorer classes generally
havemorechildrenthantherich, yetthatpersonsofdistinction, who
haveenjoyedgreatsocialpromotion, arefoundtohavefewerchildren
thanpersonsofequaldistinctionwhohavebeenlesspromoted.

Again,
although amongthegeneralpopulationthelargerfamilies oftheless
successful classes produce a negative correlation between the ability
of a child, measured in various ways, and the size of the family to
whichhebelongs, yetinselectedgroupsofchildren, chosenasreceiv-
ing more equal social opportunities, we should expect to find, as
indeedisfound,withtheYalestudents, andtoalessdegreewithsome
middle-class English schools, that the correlations tend to be raised
toapositive value. Allthesefactswouldbehighlyparadoxicalupon
the view that the differences in fertility were the direct result of
differences in social environment.

Intheproblemofthedecayofrulingclassesitisshownthatneither

to which we have traced the inversion of must have been
fertility
operative inthemost ancient civilizations, as in our own, and serve
to explain the historical importance of ruling races, through the
absence oftheproperattributesinthenativepopulations. The same
causes ensure an adverse selection acting upon each conquering
people in turn.

The decline of barbarianpeoples, whichhave receivedthe civiliza-
tion, and shared the decay, of some more advanced state, without
suffering
fromaforeignclimate orfromintermixturewithaninferior

more capable members.

appreciation of them, seem to be ascribable to the socialselection of
this type of society.

The selectionin favour of the qualities admired among barbarian

### Apology

ITis to be supposed thatallscientific men accept,atleastintheory,

the view that the advancement of biological knowledge will ulti-
mately be of service in the practical affairs of mankind; but there
canbelittle doubtthatmostwouldfeelsome embarrassmentiftheir
views had to be made the basis of practical, and therefore contro-
versial, policy. There is good reason for this ; for scientific men, no
lessthanothers,imbibe,beforetheirprofessionischosen,andperhaps
later,thesame
passions
and
prejudicesrespecting
human affairsasdo
the rest of mankind ; and while the standard of critical impartiality
necessary to science may, perhaps, be easily maintained, so long as
we are discussingthe embryologyof a sea-urchin, orthe structure of
astellaratmosphere,itcannotbereliedonwithconfidenceinsubjects
in whichthese prejudices are aroused. Any failure in this respect is,
moreover, harmful to Science. The enthusiast whose sole interest in
science is to find support for a preconceived social policy, not only
deceives himself, and perhaps others, who are not aware of his bias,
but inevitably brings some discredit upon all other workers in the
same field. The investigator undoubtedly best preserves both his
scientific reputation and his peace of mind, who refrains from any
opinion respecting human affairs, and declines the responsibility for
any practical action which might be based upon the facts he has
brought to light. If such a one were to admit that mankind might,
with advantage, make more use of scientific knowledge of all kinds,
hispracticalpolicywould, apparently,gonofurtherthantoadvocate
amore generaldiffusionofthisscientificknowledge,itsapplicationto
mundane affairs being relegated to others (unspecified) who might
make it their particular business.

Thereaderwillhaverealizedthatourconclusionsastotheselective
agencies at work in civilized societies come perilously near to being
capable of practical application. Conscious as I am of the incon-
veniences of such a course, it would appear to me merely cynicalif,
having established, as I believe, the main cause of the instability of
human civilizations, I were not to attempt at least to specify the
conditions of permanence for a civilization similar to our own. If
theseconditionsshouldseemtoinvolvefar-reachingchanges,difficult
to be brought about, I trust this will not be imputed to the very
academic
irresponsibility
whichIamanxioustodeprecate, buttothe
deep-seated nature of the cause to which the instability has been
traced.

### A permanent civilization not necessarily unprogressive
By apermanent civilizationitisevidentthatweshouldnot mean
a rigid or a stagnant one. Our current civilization does already, no
doubt, embrace the entire earth, althoughithasnotyet experienced
the final reactions to it of several important bodies of people. We
may, however, grant that it has no competition to fear, without
admittingthat, to be permanent, it neednot be progressive. For, so
longasitexists,progressinthe sciencesandartswillcertainlychange
the environment in which men live, and thereby change the social
value of different kinds of men. It is, in fact, a necessary condition
of the permanence of a civilization resembling our own, that the
humanrace shouldbe capable of makingbiologicalprogressinwhat-
ever direction may be required bythe currentstateofsociety. Even
ifitwereargued,therefore,thatarigidsystemofoccupationalcastes,
eachcompelledtobeartheburdenofits own necessaryreproduction,
would ensure biological permanence, much as the permanence of a
society of genes is ensured in cell-division, yet this could not be
admitted as solvingthe problem of apermanent civilization. Onthe
otherhand, this phrase need not be taken to imply an absolute im-
munity against destruction from all causes, but only such mundane
immortality as is enjoyed by one-celled animals and plants, which
mayperish, andindeeddoingreatnumbers, butwhichhave,intheir
innerconstitution, noinevitable causes ofsenility and decay.

Redistribution of births
The most obvious requirement for a society capable of making
evolutionary progress, in accordance with its current needs, is that
reproduction should be somewhat more active among its more
successful, than among its less successful members. In comparison
with the actual distribution of reproduction found in civilized
societies, such a condition, apart from the reason for which it is
propounded, orthemeansbywhichitmaybebrought about, would
seem to be attended by considerable advantages. Extreme poverty
would
certainly
bemitigated, andamoreevendistributionofwealth
insensibly brought about. There would be less need for the process
of transferring wealth from the rich to the poor by direct taxation,
andthisshouldbewelcomedbythosewhobelievethatthisprocessis
in practice extremely inefficient, in that the real wealth transferred
tothepooris muchlessthanthelossincurred,directly and indirectly,
by the rich. There is, I believe, only one undesirable consequence
whichwouldseem,atfirstsight,tofollowfromaredistributionofthe
incidence of reproduction, namely that the accumulation of capital,
now possibleinthe wealthierclasses, might be diminished. Without
denying that this might be an effect of a more adequate birth-rate
among the wealthier classes, it is possible at least to see a counter-
vailingadvantage
;
foriftherewerelessfreemoneyforinvestment,or,
at least if a rise ininterest rates, were necessary to induce the same
rate of the accumulation of savings, the capital withdrawn from
the investment as money, wouldinfact, have been invested in the
production of men of average ability somewhat above that of the
general population, and adequately educated for their work in life.

This is a form of capital which also earns dividends, and is, indeed,

### Social promotion of fertility
Amoderate superiorityofupperclassfertilitywould,if we accept
theargumentofChapterXI,beestablished,withoutinterferencewith
personal liberty, by a moderate tendencytowards the social promo-
tion of the more fertile strains in the population, using this phrase
to designate those who, whether physically or psychologically, are
more inclined to bring children into the world. Different as such
a condition seems from the incidence of the system of wages and
salaries current inthis country, it certainly appears on examination
thatourwagesystemcouldwithsome advantagebe modifiedinthis
direction,bothfromthepointofviewofthepurelyeconomicfunction
of the wage system, and from that of current canons of natural
justice. If, postponing the consideration of the machinerybywhich
equitable arrangements are made between different employers, we
contrast, with the utmost simplicity, the two systems by which the
amountsreceivedbytheemployedmaybedetermined, (A)equalpay
for equal work, implying considerable differences in the standards
of living, of industrially equivalent persons, supporting families of
different sizes, or, measured in the realities of consumption and
savings, a bonus for childlessness of about 12 per cent, of the basic
wage, foreach child avoided, against (B) anequal standard of living
for equal work, by the inclusion in the wage of a family allowance
equivalenttothe actual average cost of the children, it will be seen
that the second system (B) while abolishing the social promotion of
effectivesterility,possessestheeconomic advantageofincreasingthe
inducementtoincreasedefficiency. Thewagesystemissimplifiedfor
the recipient, whose standard of living now depends solely upon the
value ofthe services which he can perform regarding the system of
;
differential wages or salaries as a means by which the community,
eitherdirectlyorthroughtheprivateemployer,inducestheindividual
to perform socially valuable services, its capacity is now wholly
exerted towards this end, instead of being, as in the first system (A)
partiallydissipatedininducing him also to refrainfromparenthood.

A
principal motive for the adoption of the systems of family
allowances, now almostuniversalinFrance, was the need of making
provisionforthe children of the poorer wage-earners inthepost-war
period, when it was felt that French industry could not bear the
burden of maintaining a satisfactory standard of living among the
workers, if it were also saddled with the necessity of supporting a
higher standard of living for those amongthemwho were childless.

In this respect the French system may be regarded as aimed at
relieving poverty without increasing the burden of wages borne by
the industry; though it is probablethat,in the outcome, the saving
effectedbytheredistribution of wageshasbeen dividedbetweenthe
work-people, as wage earners, and the industries which they serve,
the advantage to these being in part handed on to the general body
of consumers in the form of lower prices. As soon as it became
realized that these advantages could be gained, by the simple
expedient of establishingequalization pools amongthe different em-
ployers, it is easily understood that the system should have spread
rapidly.

Theactualamountspaidintooroutofthesepools onaccount
of individual employers are of course small, for any large employer
will support out of wages a number of children nearly proportional
tohistotalwagebill
;
theyplay, neverthelessanessentialpartinthe
working of the system, by removing from the individual employer
the economic inducement, which he would otherwise have, to give
employment preferentially to childless persons. Any employer who
happenstobe supporting,throughthefamily allowancesincludedin
his wage bill, more than the average number of children supported
by his association, will, therefore, recoup himself, by means of the
equalizationpool,
fromotheremployers whohappentobesupporting
less than the average numberof children.

A second motive, which was important in establishing a family
allowance system in France, was the national desire to check the
tendency towards a diminution of population through the insuffi-
ciency of the number of births to replace the existing adults. The
decline of the birth-rate hadbegun somewhat earlierinFrance than
elsewhere, and its onset had been more gradual, so that it was more
widely realized among the French people than it is now in other
European countries, and especially in Great Britain, which, after
a more sudden fall, are now failing much more considerably than is
Francetomaintainthenumbersoftheirexistingpopulations. Where-
as,however,theeconomicobjectsoftheFrenchsystem, incombating
unmeritedpoverty,ininducingindustrialcontentment, andingiving
full employment to the industrial population, seem to have been
very satisfactorily realized, the biological object of increasing the
number of births has met, so far, with no appreciable success, even
in those associations in which the allowances for the later children
are sufficient to give a positive economic inducement to further
parentage.

Whenaccountistakenoftheagedistributionoftheadult
population,the supplyof childrenfell short, in 1927, by about 9 per
cent, of thenumberneededtomaintainastationarypopulation, and
this shortage has been increasing in recent years, although much
more slowly than in England, Germany or Scandinavia. A recent
estimateforWesternandNorthernEuropeasawhole,in 1926,shows
a deficiency of 7 per cent., and in view of the rapidly falling birth-
rate amongthe larger populations in this area, it is certain that this
deficiency is increasing rapidly. In 1927 it appears to have been
about 18 per cent, for England andWales.

It is arguable, therefore, but by no means certain, that the in-
corporation of family allowances into the French wage-system has
exerted some influence towards checking the tendency to a decrease
in population though, if it is ultimately to prove itself effective in
;
this respect, it must be admitted that its action is remarkably slow.

Whether it willprove more effective to a generation that has grown
up under its influence, and whether it is largely inoperative owing
to the example of better paidclasses, to whom the systemhas sofar
been very inadequately applied, further experience can alone deter-
mine. Its importance for us is that it provides the only known
means, which has a rational expectation of proving effective, of
controlling a tendency to population decrease, which has already
gone alarminglyfar inNorthern andWestern Europe, and may be
foreseen with some confidence for English-speaking peoples in other
parts of the world.

### Inadequacy of French system

For the purpose of counteracting the socialadvantage of theless

fertile, a purpose which was, of course, far from the minds of its
founders, the system offamilyallowancesnowestablishedinFrance,
must be judged to be very inadequate. This is particularly true of
its failure to establish family allowances proportionate to the basic
wage throughoutthe salariedoccupations, for, intheabsenceofsuch
aprovision,thetendencytoeliminatethehigherlevels ofintellectual
ability, which show themselves particularly in these occupations,
must be almost unchecked. For a permanent and progressive
civilization we must postulate that this defect should be remedied,
arequirement whichisthe more moderate since the system presents
the same economic advantages to whatever income levels it be
applied. A more serious difficulty seems to be presented in counter-
acting the social promotion of the less fertile in occupations not in
receipt of fixed wages or salaries, but rewarded by fees or payments
frommanydifferentindividuals. Saveinapopulationanxioustodo
the best for itself, both biologically and economically, the economic
situation ofthese occupations must present a difficulty; thoughwith
goodwill, and in pursuit of an intentional policy, the difficulty
wouldseemtolieratherwiththeestablishment,thanwiththework-
ing,
ofasystem ofmutualinsurance, whichwouldprovide aredistri-
bution of income equivalent to that experienced by the earners of
wages and salaries. Ifthe bulk of the population were convincedby
experience of the advantages of the system to those involved, it
wouldbe surprisingif theremaindershouldprove themselvesunable
todevise andadoptco-operativeschemessuitabletotheirownneeds.

The foregoing paragraphs will have served their purpose if they
have put before the reader, in a sufficiently definite and concrete
form, the proposition that it is not inherently impossible for a
civilization essentially similar to our own to be so organized as to
obviate the disastrous biological consequences to which our own
seemstobeexposed. Itistobepresumedthatmuchmoreadvantage-
ous proposals could be elaborated. My point is merely that the bio-
logicaldifficulty,thoughintimatelyrelatedtoeconomicorganization,
is not imposed uponmankind by economic necessity.

### Problem of existing populations
Ifweturnfromtherelativelyeasyproblemofspecifyingthecondi-
tions, on which a human society might avoid the unfortunate bio-
logical consequences of the selective agencies, by which human
societies are threatened, to the problem of establishing an equally
advantageous condition, among the populations of our existing
civilization, itis
obviousthatweshallbefacedwiththenecessityfor
farmoredrasticmethodsthanthosewhichwouldsufficefortheeasier
problem. For existing populations are already stratified in respect
of the various innate characters which have, in recent centuries,
favoured socialpromotion. This has been demonstrated, inthe case
of intelligence, bythe comparison of the average scores attained, by
the children of different occupational groups, in the tests judged by
psychologists to be most suitable for gauging intelligence. What is,
perhaps, more important, is that a number of qualities of the moral
character, such as the desireto do well, fortitude and persistence in
overcomingdifficulties,thejustmanlinessofagoodleader,enterprise
and imagination, qualities whichseemessentialfortheprogress, and
evenforthestableorganizationofsociety,must,atleastequallywith
intelligence, have led to social promotion, and have suffered, in
consequence, arelative concentrationin themore prosperous strata
of existing populations. These classes have, however, also been
selected forrelative infertility. We have seenreason to believe that
theymustbe,tosomeextent,congenitallyaversetotheconsequences
of normal reproduction in existing economic conditions, and to
someextent, also, to actions such as early and relatively imprudent
marriage, which are favourable to reproduction. They are now
producing, in countries such as England, probably less than half the
children needed to maintain their numbers, and there can be no
doubt that this fraction is still decreasing somewhat rapidly. The
reformer must expect to encounter deep-seated opposition in the
classesonwhichhewould naturallyrelyforan intelligentanxietyfor
the future of their country, owing to the fact that many in these
classes owe the social promotion of their forbears, and their present
prosperity, less to the value of their services to society than to a
congenital deficiency in their reproductive instincts. While it is
certain, however,thatoppositionwillbeexperiencedfromthissource,
it cannot be affirmed with certainty that members of the more
prosperous classes in receipt of salaries would not respond to a
generous system of family allowances, sufficiently to maintain their
numbers, afteraninitiallossofaconsiderablefractionofthevaluable
qualities now concentrated in these classes. The decline in fertility
has been more rapid among the more prosperous classes than in the
generalpopulation and, inso far as thisis dueto these classes being
more sensitive to economic and prudential considerations, we might
reasonably anticipate that their response to family allowances on a
scale adequate to meet the actual expenditureincurredinrespect of
children, mightbemore rapid and ultimatelygreater thanthatofthe
other classes. If this were so, and if, at the same time, preferential
promotion of infertile strains from the less prosperous classes were
entirelytocease,itseemsnotimpossiblethatthe fertilityoftheupper
classes might be restored, by the differential elimination of the less
fertile strains, within no verylengthyhistoricalperiod.

The length of the time necessarily required before the present
agencies causing racial deterioration could be completely annulled,
presents, perhaps, the most formidable obstacleto suchan attempt.

Itwouldbe contraryto allexperience to supposethatthehistory of
the nexttwo centuries willnot be broken byviolentpoliticalvicissi-
tudes. The policy of everynation will doubtless, from time to time,
fall under the sway of irrational influences, and the steadfastness
of intention necessary to maintain a policy in pursuit of a remote,
thoughgreat, advantage, however clearlythereasonsforthat policy
were perceived, is not to be expected of every people. Peoples
naturallyfactious andrivenbymutualdistrust cannot wellexert, or
even attempt, any great effort. This, however, is no reason for men
ofgoodwilltoabandonindespairsuchinfluenceforgoodasisplaced
within theirreach.

A people among whom no rational motive for reproduction is
widely recognized, butwho are principally urged thereto by impru-
denceand
superstition,will,inevitably
and
rapidly,
becomeirrational
andfanatical
.

The experienceofpreviouscivilizationsshouldwarnus
of the probability of the increase of these elements among modern
peoples. We should not ignore the possibility that even a rightly
directed policy, adopted with enthusiasm, might be frustrated by
this cause before it had time to work its effects. This danger would
perhaps be minimized if the knowledge that parenthood, by worthy
citizens, constituted an important public service, were widely in-
stilled in the education of all, and if this service were adequately
recognized as such in the economic system.

A danger of a more intellectual kind lies in the growing tendency
towards adivorcebetweentheoryand practice. Specializationinthe
sphere of intellectual endeavour is necessary, and justified by the
limitations imposed by nature upon our individual abilities. There
is less justification for the thinker to detach himself from the
natural outcome, in the real world, of his theoretical researches.

Such detachment sterilizes theory as much as it blinds practice. It
carrieswithitthenatural,butunfortunateconsequence,thatthemen
of will and energy whose business is practical achievement, having
learnt a natural contempt for irresponsible theorists, should also
ignore the practical guidance afforded by theoretical considera-
tions.

Itwouldbeidletospeculateupontheprobabilitythatourciviliza-
tion should attain that permanence which has been denied to all its
predecessors. The thought that the odds may be heavily against us
should not influence our actions. The crew of a threatened ship are
not interested in insurance rates, but in the practical dangers of
navigation. Without ignoring these dangers we may perhaps gain
some hope in that they are not wholly uncharted.

### Summary

A redistribution of births, apart from the reason for which it is

propounded, orthe means bywhichit maybe brought about, would
be attended byeconomic advantages.

A
moderate social promotion of fertility, such as should maintain
a favourable birth-rate, is not incompatible with the economic
organization of our own civilization, and would provide a means of
combating the currenttendencyto adecrease of population.

The system of family allowances adopted in France is, however,
definitely inadequate to preserve the higher levels of intellectual
ability. There is, at present, no reason to doubt that a permanent
civilization might be established on a more complete system.

The composition of existing populations, graded both in social
ability and in effective infertility, presents special, and much graver
difficulties, which onlyapeople capable of deliberate andintentional
policy could hope to overcome.
